Threats are the glue that bind alliances together.  The narrative of the 1AC sustains and perpetuates securitization.</h4><p>Alexandra <strong>Gheciu</strong> First Published March 19, <strong>2019</strong> Article Commentary NATO, liberal internationalism, and the politics of imagining the Western security community doi.org/10.1177/0020702019834645 https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0020702019834645</p><p><u><r class="highlighted">In recent years, there has been renewed interest among</r></u> International Relations <u><r class="highlighted">(IR) scholars in the ability of the Western security community to protect itself from a variety of threats and challenge</r></u>s. In this context, longstanding debates concerning <u><r class="highlighted">the role played by</r></u> the organization that is widely regarded as the institutional expression of that community—<u><r class="highlighted">NATO</r></u>—have recently taken on new dimensions. Scholars and policymakers often disagree in their interpretations of the relative strength of NATO, but <u><r class="highlighted">many agree that the alliance needs to play a central role in protecting the West from a mix of conventional and non-conventional dangers</r></u>, ranging from an increasingly assertive Russia to transnational terrorism. One of the key assumptions underpinning many analyses is that <u><r class="highlighted">NATO constitutes the institutional expression of a pre-existing Western security community united around liberal-democratic norms and values</r></u>. However, a close reading of the alliance’s history shows that, far from simply representing a pre-given community, <u><r class="highlighted">NATO has always been involved in constructing “the West.”</r></u> At the heart of that process of social construction lie practices of collective (re)imagining of the Western world in specific ways, as well as the representation—and management of—internal tensions as feuds within a community united by shared liberal values. Today, the task of managing internal differences has been rendered particularly difficult by the rise of radical conservative political forces in several allied states. This has translated into a clash between liberal and illiberal interpretations of the Western security community, which has the potential to seriously complicate inter-allied relations in the foreseeable future. As this paper shows, contrary to conventional wisdom, middle powers have always played important roles in the constitution of the Western security community. More recently, they have also played significant roles in contesting liberal interpretations of the security community, and articulating an alternative, radical conservative vision of the West. Recent developments in allied countries such as Turkey and Poland are a potent reminder that not all middle powers are alike; on the contrary, based on their socially constructed, historically specific definitions of identity, they can perform a diversity of international roles—in support of, or, conversely, as obstacles to liberal internationalism. The narrative of Western unity and the politics of collective forgetting during the Cold War <u><r class="highlighted">One of the most influential narratives of international security put forward</r></u> by liberal IR scholars and practitioners <u><r class="highlighted">centres on the Euro-Atlantic security community</r></u>, consisting of a group of countries <u><r class="highlighted">united around a set of key liberal norms and institutions that generate “dependable expectations” of peaceful resolution of conflicts that might arise among them</r></u>.1 From that perspective, <u><r class="highlighted">NATO is an institution</r> </u>that was <u><r class="highlighted">created in the context of the Cold War to protect the pre-existing security community from the threats posed by the West’s dangerous other</r></u>: the communist bloc. Yet, as a series of constructivist scholars have persuasively argued, there is nothing natural about the Western security community.2 In Emanuel Adler’s words, “<u><r class="highlighted">security communities are socially constructed and rest on shared practical knowledge of the peaceful resolution of conflicts</r></u>.”3 Furthermore, <u><r class="highlighted">the absence of violence should not lead us to conclude that the construction of security communities in general and the Western community in particular were power-free processes</r></u>. On the contrary, as Adler and Barnett explain, central to the establishment of a security community is the dialectic between power—primarily symbolic power—and knowledge.4 Thus, in the physically non-violent context of security communities, <u><r class="highlighted">power is primarily “the authority to determine the shared meanings that embody the identities, interests and practices of states, as well as</r></u> the conditions that confer, <u><r class="highlighted">defer or deny access to goods and benefits.”</r></u>5 Applying this logic to the specific case of NATO, we can see the alliance not as the institutional expression of a pre-given community, but, rather, as <u><r class="highlighted">an organization that has been deeply involved in power-filled practices of construction and reproduction of that community</r></u>.6 Historical evidence indicates that the founders of NATO—policymaking elites from the United Kingdom, Canada, the United States, France, and the Benelux states—did not take the Western security community for granted. Instead, they engaged in a systematic set of practices aimed at constructing a sense of community around a shared set of liberal-democratic norms in the Euro-Atlantic area, and placed the newly created North Atlantic Treaty Organization at the heart of those practices. In the intergovernmental debates leading up to the establishment of NATO, the threat of military confrontation with the Soviet Union was regarded as less worrisome than the danger of communist subversion within the weakened societies of Western European states.7 In that context, as Louis St. Laurent—then Canadian Secretary of State for External Affairs—argued, the best way to prevent a third world war was by confronting “the forces of communist expansion with an overwhelming preponderance of moral, economic and military force on the side of freedom.”8 At the level of top Western political elites, the fear of communism inspired a collective (re)definition of political identity in the Euro-Atlantic area. The “spectre of Communism” provided the defining other against which decision-makers on both sides of the Atlantic were able to subordinate their differences to a collective definition of a Western community. That community was seen as based on the common heritage of political and cultural ideas of member states; its defining mark was <u><r class="highlighted">the set of shared values</r></u> <u><r class="highlighted">of individual liberal freedoms, the rule of law, and democracy.</r></u>9 This view is clearly reflected in the preamble to the Washington Treaty (NATO’s foundational treaty), which stipulates that the alliance is based on principles of democracy, individual liberty, and law.</p><br> <br> Card Number: 2<br> <br><h4>And, security is a psychological construct---the aff’s scenarios for conflict are products of paranoia that project our violent impulses onto the other </h4><p><strong>Mack 91</strong> – Doctor of Psychiatry and a professor at Harvard University (John, “The Enemy System” http://www.johnemackinstitute.org/eJournal/article.asp?id=23 *Gender modified)</p><p><u><strong>The</strong> <strong>threat of nuclear annihilation</strong></u><r class="font6"> has </r><u>stimulated us to</u><r class="font6"> try to </r><u><strong>understand what it is about (hu)mankind that has led to </strong><r class="font6">such </r></u><r class="emphasis">self-destroying behavior</r><u>. Central to this</u><r class="font6"> inquiry </r><u>is an exploration of the adversarial relationships between ethnic or national groups. It is out of such enmities that war, including nuclear war</u><r class="font6"> should it occur, </r><u>has always arisen</u><r class="font6">. </r><u>Enmity</u><r class="font6"> between groups of people </r><u>stems from the interaction of psychological</u><r class="font6">, economic, and cultural </r><u>elements. These include fear and hostility</u><r class="font6"> (which are often closely related), </r><u>competition over perceived scarce resources,[3] the need for individuals to identify with a large group</u><r class="font6"> or cause,[4] </r><u>a tendency to disclaim</u><r class="font6"> and assign </r><u>elsewhere responsibility for unwelcome impulses</u><r class="font6"> and intentions, </r><u>and a peculiar susceptibility to emotional manipulation</u><r class="font6"> by leaders who play upon our more savage inclinations in the name of national security or the national interest. </r><u>A full understanding of the "enemy system"<r class="font6">[3]</r> requires insights from</u><r class="font6"> many specialities, including </r><u>psychology</u><r class="font6">, anthropology, history, political science, and the humanities. In their statement on violence[5] twenty </r><u>social and behavioral scientists</u><r class="font6">, who met in Seville, Spain, to examine the roots of war, </r><u>declared that <r class="highlighted">there was <strong>no scientific basis for</strong></r><strong> </strong><r class="highlighted"><strong>regarding (hu)man(s) as</strong></r> <r class="font6">an</r> <strong>innately </strong><r class="highlighted"><strong>aggressive</strong></r></u><r class="font6"> animal, </r><u>inevitably committed to war</u><r class="font6">. The Seville statement implies that </r><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">we have real choices</r></r><r class="font6">. It also points to a hopeful paradox of the nuclear age: </r><u>threat of nuclear war may have provoked our capacity for fear-driven polarization but at the same time it has inspired unprecedented efforts towards cooperation and settlement of differences without violence.</u><r class="font6"> The Real and the Created Enemy </r><u>Attempts to <strong>explore the psychological roots of enmity</strong> are <r class="font6">frequently </r>met with responses on the following lines: "<strong>I can accept psychological explanations of things, </strong></u><r class="emphasis">but <r class="highlighted">my enemy is real</r></r><r class="font6">. </r><u>The Russians</u><r class="font6"> [or Germans, Arabs, Israelis, Americans] </r><u>are armed, threaten us, and intend us harm</u><r class="font6">. Furthermore, </r><u>there are real differences between us and our national interests, such as competition over oil, land, or other scarce resources, and genuine conflicts <r class="font6">of values</r></u><r class="font6"> </r><u>between our </u><r class="font6">two</r><u> nations</u><r class="font6">. </r><u>It is essential that we be strong and maintain a balance or superiority of <strong>military and political power</strong>, lest the other side take advantage of our weakness". This</u><r class="font6"> argument </r><u><r class="highlighted">does not address</r> the distinction between the</u><r class="font6"> enemy </r><u>threat and </u><r class="emphasis">one's own contribution to that threat</r><r class="font6">-</r><strong><u>by distortions of perception</u></strong><r class="font6">, provocative words, and actions. In short, </r><u>the enemy is real, but <strong>we have not learned to understand </strong><r class="highlighted"><strong>how </strong></r></u><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">we </r>have <r class="highlighted">created that enemy</r></r><r class="font6"><r class="highlighted">,</r> </r><u>or how the threatening image we hold of the enemy relates to its actual intentions. "<r class="highlighted">We never see our enemy</r>'s motives</u><r class="font6"> and we never labor to assess his will, </r><u><r class="highlighted">with</r> </u><r class="emphasis">anything approaching <r class="highlighted">objectivity</r></r><r class="font6">".[6] Individuals may have little to do with the choice of national enemies. Most Americans, for example, know only what has been reported in the mass media about the Soviet Union. </r><u>We are largely unaware of the forces that operate within our institutions, affecting the thinking of our leaders and ourselves, and which determine how the Soviet Union will be represented to us</u><r class="font6">. Ill-will and a desire for revenge are transmitted from one generation to another, and </r><u><r class="highlighted"><strong>we are not taught to </strong></r></u><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">think </r>critically</r><u><strong> </strong><r class="highlighted"><strong>about how</strong></r><strong> </strong></u><r class="emphasis">our assigned <r class="highlighted">enemies are selected</r> for us. </r><r class="font6">In the relations between potential adversarial nations there will have been, inevitably, real grievances that are grounds for enmity. But the attitude of one people towards another is usually determined by leaders who manipulate the minds of citizens for domestic political reasons which are generally unknown to the public. As Israeli sociologist Alouph Haveran has said, </r><u>in times of conflict between nations <r class="highlighted"><strong>historical accuracy is the first victim</strong></r><r class="font6">.[8] </r></u><r class="font6">The Image of the Enemy and How We Sustain It Vietnam veteran William Broyles wrote: "</r><r class="emphasis">War begins in the mind, with the idea of the enemy</r><r class="font6">."[9] But </r><u>to sustain that idea</u><r class="font6"> in war and peacetime </r><u>a nation's leaders must maintain public support for the massive expenditures that are required. Studies of enmity have revealed susceptibilities</u><r class="font6">, though not necessarily recognized as such by the governing elites that provide raw material </r><u>upon which the leaders may draw to sustain the image of an enemy.[7,</u><r class="font6">10] </r><u>Freud[11] in his examination of mass psychology identified the proclivity of individuals to <strong>surrender personal responsibility to the leaders of large groups</strong></u><r class="font6">. This surrender takes place in both totalitarian and democratic societies, and without coercion. Leaders can therefore designate outside enemies and take actions against them with little opposition. Much further research is needed to understand the </r><u><r class="highlighted">psychological</r> <r class="highlighted">mechanisms</r></u><r class="font6"> that </r><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">impel individuals to</r> kill or <r class="highlighted">allow killing</r></r><r class="font6"> in their name, often </r><u>with little questioning of the <strong>morality or consequences</strong> of such actions</u><r class="font6">. Philosopher and psychologist Sam Keen asks why it is that in virtually every war "The enemy is seen as less than human? He's faceless. He's an animal"." Keen tries to answer his question: "</r><u>The image of the enemy</u><r class="font6"> is not only the soldier's most powerful weapon; it </r><u>is society's most powerful weapon. <strong>It enables people en masse to </strong></u><r class="emphasis">participate in acts of violence</r><u> </u><r class="font6">they would never consider doing as individuals".[12] National leaders become skilled in presenting the adversary in dehumanized images. The mass media, taking their cues from the leadership, contribute powerfully to the process.</r></p><br> <br> Card Number: 3<br> <br><h4>Our response is to interrogate the epistemological failures of the 1ac---this is a prerequisite to successful policy </h4><p><strong>Ahmed 12</strong> Dr. Nafeez Mosaddeq Ahmed is Executive Director of the Institute for Policy Research and Development (IPRD), an independent think tank focused on the study of violent conflict, he has taught at the Department of International Relations, University of Sussex "The international relations of crisis and the crisis of international relations: from the securitisation of scarcity to the militarisation of society" Global Change, Peace &amp; Security Volume 23, Issue 3, 2011 Taylor Francis</p><p><r class="font6">While </r><u><r class="highlighted">recommendations to </r></u><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">shift our frame</r> of orientation</r><u> away from conventional </u><r class="emphasis">state-centrism</r><u> <r class="highlighted">toward</r> a </u><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">'human security' approach</r></r><r class="font6"><r class="highlighted"> </r></r><u>are valid, this <r class="highlighted">cannot be achieved without confronting</r> the </u><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">deeper theoretical assumptions</r></r><r class="font6"><r class="highlighted"> </r></r><u>underlying </u><r class="emphasis">conventional approaches to 'non-traditional' security issues</r><r class="font6">.106 </r><u>By occluding the </u><r class="emphasis">structural origin</r><r class="font6"> </r><u>and </u><r class="emphasis">systemic dynamic</r><r class="font6"> </r><u>of</u><r class="font6"> global </r><r class="emphasis">ecological, energy and economic crises</r><r class="font6">, </r><u>orthodox approaches are </u><r class="emphasis">incapable of transforming them</r><r class="font6">.

The first is the extent to which either condition can generate socio-political crises that challenge or undermine the prevailing order. The second is the way in which stakeholder actors choose to actually respond to the latter crises. </r><u>To understand these factors accurately requires close attention to the political, economic and ideological </u><r class="emphasis">strictures of resource exploitation, consumption and distribution</r><r class="font6"> between different social groups and classes. </r><r class="emphasis">Overlooking the systematic causes</r><u> of social crisis leads to a heightened tendency to </u><r class="emphasis">problematise its symptoms</r><u>,</u><r class="font6"> in the forms of challenges from particular social groups. </r><u>This can lead to </u><r class="emphasis">externalisation of those groups</r><u>, </u><r class="emphasis">and</r><u> the </u><r class="emphasis">legitimisation of violence towards them</r><u>.

They have collapsed when the need for a balance disappeared as a result of either power crumbling or threat perceptions changing. <u><r class="highlighted">While the origins of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) can be found in its members’ perceived need to balance rising Soviet power in the aftermath of World War II,</r></u> the collapse of Soviet imperial rule in the late 1980s did not lead to NATO’s demise. For that reason, <u><r class="highlighted">NATO is often referred to as the most successful military alliance in history.</r></u> Not only did it prove to be the key instrument in defending its members against Soviet attack or subversion and in helping to speed Soviet disintegration, the Atlantic Alliance survived and, at times, thrived in the decade since the disappearance of the Soviet threat robbed NATO of its main raison d'être. If success is measured by longevity, then NATO has rightly earned its historic designation. <u><r class="highlighted">What accounts for NATO’s persistence? Three factors</r></u> can be cited<u><r class="highlighted">. First, in the immediate aftermath of Soviet imperial rule, few were ready to throw the Alliance overboard.</r></u> As former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher remarked at the time, “You don’t cancel your home insurance policy just because there have been fewer burglaries on your street in the last 12 months!”1 <u><r class="highlighted">The need to hedge against an uncertain future was reflected</r></u> in the new Alliance strategic concept, adopted in November 1991 by NATO Heads of State and Government just days before the Soviet collapse. This concept pointedly noted that <u><r class="highlighted">the need to “preserve the strategic balance in Europe” would remain one of NATO’s four fundamental security tasks.2 Second, the Alliance has always meant more than providing a countervailing balance to Soviet power</r></u>. To a considerable extent, <u><r class="highlighted">NATO evolved into a community of like-minded states, united not just by their opposition to Soviet communism but also by their determination</r></u> (as the preamble to the North Atlantic Treaty of 1949 stated) “<u><r class="highlighted">to safeguard the freedom, common heritage and civilization of their peoples, founded on the principles of democracy, individual liberty, and the rule of law</r></u>.”3 Over time, NATO grew from being an alliance principally dedicated to protecting its members against military threat or attack into the principal NATO in the 21st century - 7 - Final – March 19, 2001 institutional expression of the transatlantic community of states and the western values that both defined and united them. Together, the NATO allies formed a viable, yet pluralistic security community, one where (with the possible exception of Greece and Turkey) the thought of settling any dispute among its members by the threat or use of force has been ruled out a priori. 4 That community remains as vibrant today as it did at the height of the cold war. Third, when the military organization was established in the early 1950s to give full expression to the collective defense commitment of the Washington Treaty, the basis was laid for a large bureaucracy, staffed by many thousands of people dedicated to the organization and its mission. While old soldiers may fade away, large organizations rarely do. After initially resisting the need to change, the NATO bureaucracy responded, like all such bureaucracies, by seeking to adapt its mission and structure in a manner relevant to its new environment. <u><r class="highlighted">On the military side, internal adaptation has taken the form of a streamlined and more flexible command structure capable of deploying military forces rapidly and over greater distances than was the case during the cold war. Politically, the Alliance has sought new missions to retain its relevance – from peacekeeping to countering the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD).</r></u> In the process, NATO has not only survived but been transformed into a politico-military entity that differs in many significant ways from the organization that stood ready to meet a Warsaw Pact tank assault across the Fulda Gap.</p><br> <br> Card Number: 5<br> <br><h4>Cooperation with NATO symbolizes a commitment to a common western identity grounded in the logic of threat construction and securitization</h4><p>Gabi <strong>Schlag</strong> Re-constituting NATO: Foundational Narratives of Transatlantic Security Cooperation in the 1950s and 1990s. Uses of “the West”, 156–178. doi:10.1017/9781316717448.008 Print publication year: <strong>2016</strong></p><p>One could imagine that the saying ‘There is life in an old dog yet’ fits quite well for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Many serious challenges threatened its cohesion, such as the Suez crisis in 1956, the disputes over the so-called double-track decision in 1979, and the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact in 1993. While the history of the alliance has often been told as a history of crises (e.g. Stanley Hoffman, 1981), neither internal disputes over the war in Iraq nor the disappearance of a ‘communist threat’ have led to a break-up of NATO. <u><r class="highlighted">The transatlantic alliance lives on. It has even expanded in size and tasks</r></u> after the end of the Cold War. Recent tensions between ‘the West’ and Russia over Crimea and Ukraine make clear that the Atlantic alliance is anything but dead. As Stephen Walt put it: ‘NATO owes Putin a big thank-you’ (Walt, 2014). In International Relations (IR), debates on the Atlantic alliance have witnessed ups and downs as well. While realist, liberal, and institutionalist scholars strove to explain the existence and persistence of NATO by referring either to an alliance against threat (Walt, 1990, 1997), an alliance of democracies (Risse-Kappen, 1995, Risse, 1996), or a security manager (Wallander, 2000), other approaches have advocated a more critical and reflective understanding of the discourses and practices which constitute(d) the alliance in the first place (Klein, 1990; Bially Mattern, 2005; Behnke, 2013; Hellmann, 2006; Jackson 2003; Neumann and Williams, 2000; Pouliot, 2010; Adler, 2008). <u><r class="highlighted">NATO’s lasting ability to overcome internal and external challenges to its cohesion</r></u>, I will argue, directs our attention exactly to the discursive practices which enabled a continuous re-constitution of a Western security community. By re-constitution I refer to the Janus-faced process of activating and transforming foundational narratives which justify the existence and continuity of NATO. This process commonly includes constructions of threats and a sense of a shared identity which are both ingrained in symbolic orders and mobilized by articulations of a common security strategy. Of further interest, therefore, is how <u><r class="highlighted">the allies</r></u> answered the question why NATO should exist, how they invented and <u><r class="highlighted">used a common notion of identity, interests, and threats in order to justify a deep and lasting pattern of military cooperation between North America and (Western</r></u>) <u><r class="highlighted">European states.</r></u> Such a critical constructivist approach directs our attention to the political dynamics whereby a Western security community is invented in the first place instead of already presuming it as taken for granted (cf. Tilly, 1998; Bartelson, 2009; Herborth, 2009).

This article provides insight into the longevity and feasibility of cooperation initiatives by the EU and NATO by surveying both the bureaucratic and the strategic challenges faced. The inception of the European Union (EU) during the post Second World War era is perhaps the true starting point for analysing how transatlantic security cooperation adapted a self-sustaining and mutually reconcilable rationale. Winston Churchill’s <a href="http://www.churchill-society-london.org.uk/astonish.html">call</a> for supranational European solidarity — a call for a “United States of Europe” — in his 1946 Zurich speech was not only necessitated by strategic US forebodings during the prelude to the Cold War, but also by a maturing understanding of the requirements of international security on both sides of the Atlantic. With this call for unity in mind, European Coal and Steel Community was conceived to foster economic interdependence among its members. From there on it surpasses its original purpose in becoming a safeguard of common European values. The American counterpart, <u><r class="highlighted">NATO, was formed on the foundational principle of collective defence and deterrence</r></u>, <u><r class="highlighted">and emerged as a military alliance</r></u> with abundant economic and political interests. Historically, <u><r class="highlighted">NATO has prioritised the military and security</r> </u>while the EU aimed for economic and developmental progress. However, similar to the EU, <u><r class="highlighted">NATO is an organization with an ever increasing dedication to a common set of values, through which is seeks to ensure stabilization and peace</r></u>. Although <u><r class="highlighted">NATO operates on</r></u> more <u><r class="highlighted">militaristic grounds</r></u> than the EU, the alliance has overhauled its solely military focus to envision a wider appreciation of values, including <a href="https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/topics_111582.htm">transparency and accountability</a> as well as <a href="https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_91091.htm">women, science and environment for peace and security</a>. NATO and EU’s positions -what they want- and interests -why they want- have not always overlapped. For instance, <u><r class="highlighted">NATO actions had been in parallel to maintaining American unipolarity in the global order</r></u> contrasted with EU prioritizing the multiscale cooperation with its neighbors and other world powers, including China, Russia and India. Exemplified by disapproving European position of American invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan, NATO’s non-regional interventions is <a href="https://www.iss.europa.eu/sites/default/files/EUISSFiles/Report_8-What_do_Europeans_want_from_NATO_0.pdf">advised</a> to be exceptions rather than a rule by EU Institute for Security Studies.</p><br> <br> Card Number: 7<br> <br><h4>NATO is an integrated military structure highly trained and schooled in both overt and subtle security planning.</h4><p>Celeste A. <strong>Wallander</strong> Institutional Assets and Adaptability: NATO after the Cold War Author(s): Source: International Organization , Autumn, <strong>2000</strong>, Vol. 54, No. 4 (Autumn, 2000), pp. 705-735 Published by: The MIT Press Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/2601379</p><p><u><r class="highlighted">The integrated command structure</r></u> as a general asset <u><r class="highlighted">is crucial to understanding why NATO-and not</r></u> <u><r class="highlighted">other institutions</r></u>, such as the UN or the Western European Union (WEU)-can act for post-Cold War military missions in Europe.

What made NATO possible in the 1990s was what was devel- oped in the Cold War to deal with the Soviet threat and the alliance's internal tasks. One official said that the OSCE was considered as a vehicle for dealing with Yugosla- via, but officials recognized what it could and could not do. The OSCE is best at establishing norms and standards for political and human rights. "We do not need NATO for every security issue, but we did need it to be able to react to the ones that were on the agenda in the 1990s."80 Why were NATO's military command structure and political decision-making pro- cedures general, rather than specific, assets? Because, observed a senior defense official, "through its political consultation, integrated military command, and organi- zations for implementation, NATO is able to do the three things that have to be done for any policy: mobilize, organize, and implement."'81 Although developed during the Cold War, these capacities translate into post-Cold War missions and are crucial for multilateral security missions. While those who value efficiency bemoan NATO's slowness, the official noted, NATO "is not for maximum efficiency, but for acting together."82 Another official, when asked why NATO has been able to adapt, an- swered that it is because all political-military missions require planning, and "during the Cold War, that is what NATO did."83 And another official answered that it is NATO that has the tools for action, listing the integrated military command, logistics, command-control-communication, and the structures for coming to a coherent and cohesive consensus, whereas the UN and the OSCE do not.84 The political issues of non-Article 5 missions make the process more difficult, he observed, but the plan- ning mechanism is basically the same: procedures for generating forces and readi- ness are on the books, the militaries understand them, and governments are accus- tomed to and ready for them. However, just as clearly as Bosnia demonstrated that NATO's political consulta- tion and integrated command structures were general assets that made it adaptable to the new security environment of risks and non-Article 5 conditions, it also demon-strated that NATO lacked important specific military assets for dealing with out-of- area non-Article 5 contingencies. <u><r class="highlighted">The alliance's potential new military missions re- quire smaller, lighter, and mobile forces with expertise and training in peacekeeping, humanitarian relief, and peace enforcement, in stark contrast to the Cold War mission</r></u> of positional defense.

Until recently, many in the West were questioning the security alliance’s purpose. As a presidential candidate in 2016, Donald Trump said that if Baltic states weren’t “paying their bills” the U.S. shouldn’t necessarily protect them from Russia notwithstanding treaty obligations. In 2019, French President Emanuele Macron asserted that NATO was “becoming brain-dead”. The following year, tensions between Greece and Turkey led some experts to conclude that NATO was “paralyzed”. At that time, 70 percent of Turkey’s population saw the U.S., NATO’s dominant military force, as a threat to their country. Many voices in the West accused Germany of being a “shaky alliance partner” and “NATO’s biggest freeloader.” But <u><r class="highlighted">Russia’s invasion of Ukraine</r></u> on 24 February <u><r class="highlighted">was a geopolitical tsunami that fundamentally changed the strategic stakes for NATO</r></u> members. Amid drastic changes in Europe’s security architecture<u><r class="highlighted">, the Western alliance has regained a sense of purpose.</r></u> <u><r class="highlighted">Today NATO is more unified and cohesive than it ever has been</r></u> since the Soviet Union’s implosion in 1991. “<u><r class="highlighted">Threat is the glue that binds together a security alliance</r></u>,” explained John Feffer, the director of Foreign Policy In Focus, in an interview with Politics Today. “<u><r class="highlighted">When the threat increases–and there is a consensus on the nature of the threat–the alliance necessarily becomes more cohesive.</r></u> Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has served to smooth over a number of disagreements within the alliance.” The Ankara-based Foreign Policy Institute’s Dr Tarik Oguzlu <a href="https://www.aa.com.tr/en/analysis/analysis-natos-impasse-in-the-ukraine-russia-war/2563261" target="_blank">wrote</a> that “as we witness NATO’s European members awaking from their geopolitical hibernation, NATO is almost returning to its founding mission.” The war in Ukraine quickly led to a “revolution in German military affairs” with Berlin now committed to a hike in defense spending. The Germans put Nord Stream 2 pipeline on hold. Berlin is also arming the Ukrainian resistance with lethal weapons despite previously opposing NATO’s militarization of Ukraine. For decades, a handful of Western countries accused Italy of being too Russia-friendly. But for the past two months, Italy has taken a strong stance against Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Now closely aligned with the Transatlantic alliance against Moscow, Rome has supported sanctioning Russia. As Italy’s Prime Minister Mario Draghi put it, Italy responded to the President of Ukraine’s appeal for weapons because “it’s not possible to respond only with encouragement” when a democratic country comes under attack. Talk in western capitals about kicking Turkey out of NATO has basically come to a sudden end. There has been somewhat of a rebound in Ankara-Washington relations as Turkey arms Kiev with Baykar TB2 drones. Based on shared concerns about Moscow’s conduct in Ukraine, Greece and Turkey have found common cause since 24 February. NATO’s Baltic members have long been far more alarmist about the Russian threat than those in Western Europe. But such <u><r class="highlighted">East-West divisions within NATO are going away. “Western politicians are now saying to us, you were right,”</r></u> Arvydas Anušauskas, Lithuania’s Minister of National Defence, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thVCPFcHpNs" target="_blank">told</a> Al Jazeera. Since 24 February, <u><r class="highlighted">NATO members “have rallied together and acted quickly with new defence and deterrence measures such as activating the NATO defence plans, activating elements of the NATO Response Force, and approving the deployment of four new multinational battlegroups in Eastern Europe,”</r></u> Mihai Chihaia, a policy analyst at the Brussels-based European Policy Centre, told Politics Today. <u><r class="highlighted">“Reinforcing the Eastern flank has been a top priority and the Allies have shown a very high degree of solidarity</r></u>. In addition, <u><r class="highlighted">the strong commitment to Article 5</r></u> (mutual defense) <u><r class="highlighted">has been constantly reiterated.” NATO is</r> </u>not only <u><r class="highlighted">becoming more unified because of a growing common threat perception</r> </u>of Russia. The security alliance might be on the verge of expanding its membership. Sweden and Finland appear close to abandoning their decades-old foreign policy tradition of neutrality and entering NATO. Finland doing so would add <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/finns-living-near-border-watch-russia-warily-recall-dark-past-2022-04-14/" target="_blank">810 miles</a> to the border between Russia and NATO members.</p><br> <br> Card Number: 9<br> <br><h4>NATO is premised on western imperialism and means all their authors assume a cold war mindset that causes perpetual war</h4><p>Andreas <strong>Behnke,</strong> Lecturer, International Relations Group that gathers the enormous and varied expertise on international politics and strategy in the Department of Politics and IR, MA (Mainz), PhD (Stockholm<strong>), 2000</strong>, 'Inscriptions of Imperial Order.

While this kind of literature is valuable in its own right, <u><r class="highlighted">its underlying assumption</r> about the adaptive logic of NATO's post-cold war policies tends to underrate the ability of the Alliance to actively shape the security environment through its <r class="highlighted">discursive construction of security political 'realities'</r> and the re-presentation of its institutional identity</u>. At the same time, this literature arguably underestimates the task confronting NATO. The collapse of the cold war order does not only pose a problem to NATO in terms of adapting to a new reality, the features of which are are supposedly as clearly discernable as the ones of the cold war itself. <u>Rather, its demise challenges NATO (and other international actors and institutions) to articulate new and stable 'structures of meaning' which can render "the unfamilar in the terms of the familiar"</u> (Campbell, 1992:4) and <u>which make it possible to re-assume political and military-strategic agency.</u> The purpose of this essay is to <u>analyze the way in which NATO is responding to these challenges</u>. <u>More specifically</u>, it <u>addresses the problem of the Alliance's <r class="highlighted">'Western' identity</r> and the strategies of inclusion and exclusion through which this identity is <r class="highlighted">re-defined</r> and re-asserted after the disappearence of the constitutive Other of the cold war, that is, <r class="highlighted">the Communist 'East'</r>. At the same time, the essay deals with NATO's search for new adversaries and threats.</u> These two issues, while often treated separately in the literature, are in fact closely related. As Owen Harries (1993:42) pointed out some years ago, <u><r class="highlighted">The political 'West' is not a natural construct</r> but a highly artificial one. It took the presence of <r class="highlighted">a life-threatening,</r> overtly hostile 'East' to bring it into existence and to maintain its unity. It is extremely doubtful whether it can now survive the disappearance of that <r class="highlighted">enemy.</r> We need not take Harries' skepticism at face value in order to appreciate the problematization of what the West actually is. Suffice it to state that matters of identity are intrinsically related to the problem of difference and adversity. The articulation of a Western identity, Harries' argument suggests, was made possible, and depended upon the presence of a hostile 'East'.</u> As Bradley Klein (1994:120-21) has argued, <u>this presence has allowed NATO to prevail and survive the many crises and internal conflicts amongst its member-states. </u>Already in the 1960s, Henry Kissinger analyzed the effects of détente on alliance cohesion in terms that anticipate to some extent the troubles NATO would face some 30 years later after the demise of the Warsaw Treaty Organization. As the détente develops, the need to transform the Alliance from its present defensive concept into a political arrangement defining itself by some positive goals will grow ever more urgent. <u>Defense against a military threat will soon lose its force as a political bond. Negotiations with the East will prove corrosive unless they go hand in hand with the creation of common political purposes and the institutions to embody them</u> (Kissinger, 1965:10). In other words, in <u>the absence of a 'life-threatening' adversary, the West runs the danger of <r class="highlighted">disintegrating and dissolving.</r> That <r class="highlighted">NATO</r> was able to avoid this fate</u> for forty years supports Klein's (1994:121) contention that the alliance strength rested on its ability to wed itself "to the defense of a distinctly modern<u>, Western, Atlantocentric cultural project" which made it possible to deflect and externalize its internal contradictions and conflicts. If we acknowledge this internal relationship between (stable) identity and (hostile) difference, we can appreciate the paradox that the end of the cold war presented a much more serious threat to NATO than the East-West confrontation ever did. For the end of the cold war also means that the unraveling of <r class="highlighted">Cold War representations</r> has raised for the first time the fundamental issue of Western identity. It is no longer clear who is to be legitimately incorporated within the space of modern <r class="highlighted">Western culture</r>.</u> ... Simply put the world under <u><r class="highlighted">NATO's guidance</r> is no longer subject to containment. It's boundaries have now been eroded...</u> (Klein, 1994:133). Consequently, the West faces the problem of 'self-determination', of defining its identity and its borders against the rest of the world. Self-determination is usually assumed to contribute to peace in the international system. Thus, the United Nations (UN) Charter states in Article 1, paragraph 2 as one of its purposes, To develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples.</p><br> <br> Card Number: 10<br> <br><h4>Depictions of a pristine biodiversity ignoring the un-ending violence caused by the west – their attempts to maintain Bio – D are not for protection but further surveillance and exploitation</h4><p>Timothy W. <strong>Luke</strong>, Professor of Political Science at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, <strong>1997</strong>, Ecocritique, p. 65-69</p><p>Until the early 1970s, TNC adhered to many essentially romantic as­sumptions about Nature in its various operations. Nature existed as a real presence in places left undisturbed by human beings.27 At such sites, therefore, all plants and animals embodied Nature’s substance, and as such they were all worthy of protection. Therefore, acquiring any and all land that was not now being touched by some human settlement’s eco­nomic and social activity constituted a meaningful act of Nature conser­vation. The battle lines were drawn across territories understood as land under active current social utilization (or artificial zones without a large Nature presence) and land no longer or not yet put to such use (or natu­ral zones without a large social presence), making it, therefore, worthy as a site of Nature conservancy. At some point in the 1960s and 1970s, these discursive frames be­came obsolete, even though many people today inside and outside of the environmental movement do not recognize their obsolescence. Bill McKibben and Carolyn Merchant, to a very real extent, are right.28 <u>Nature has ended. <r class="highlighted">Nature is dead</r></u>. Perhaps it was the conquest of extraterrestrial spaces in the moon landings of 1969—70, whose tele­visual and photographic images of the Earth sublated conceptual an­tinomies like Nature/Society, out-there/in-here, wilderness/settlement, and environment/economy in pictures of one undifferentiated little blue planet floating in space. Perhaps it was the penetration of trans­national capitalism even into Moscow and Beijing during Nixon’s detente, whose acceptance of Pepsi, Kentucky Fried Chicken, or Pan Am passengers underscored how commercial commodities now could go anywhere anytime anyone wished them to do so. Perhaps it was the collective shudder of the 1971—73 oil shocks from OPEC, whose antics illustrated how tightly coupled all human societies were to petrochemical energy supplies mostly pumped up from under a hand­ful of Mideastern deserts. <u>The brittleness in the traditional categories, <r class="highlighted">pitting “Nature” against “Society</r>,” finally snapped</u>. There really were no lands without any traces of some large social presence. Hundreds of individual plants and animals were not merely being disturbed by humanity; they were being eradi­cated as species in wholesale extinctions. Scientific observations of air quality, water quality, atmospheric integrity, bone composition, or milk production were indicating that human beings have profoundly dis­turbed what had been regarded as unalterable sovereign Nature with in­dustrial pollution, greenhouse gases, chemical contamination, and radio­active wastes. Hence, to pretend to be conserving “the untouched and undisturbed expanses of Nature” in simple actions of land ownership made very little sense<r class="highlighted">. </r><u><r class="highlighted">Nature</r></u>, as it had been conceptualized by the Ecologist’s Union in 1945 for The Nature Conservancy to preserve after 1951, <u>had been <r class="highlighted">disappearing</r> right from under everyone’s noses</u> as global modernization accelerated at even greater rates from 1945 to 1973. <u>Once-undisturbed lands could no longer be regarded as the container of Na­ture as such, <r class="highlighted">they had to be continuously reassessed to determine their ecological values,</r> creating the space of surveillance</u>, as chapters 4 and 5 argue, <u>known as “the environment.</u>”29 From 1951 to 1973, TNC did have a decidedly scientific air about its operations, even though with its haphazard policies of property acquisi­tion the organization still worked as a land collection program to pre­serve scenic beauty, rare plants, and wild animals on whatever land it would get whenever it could get it. Low-key and nonconfrontarional, The Nature Conservancy’s style of environmental protection had been fairly cozy with big business from the beginning. Under the leadership of Pat Noonan from 1973 to 1980, however, this almost accidental prece­dent was turned into an article of faith. During the intensive environ­mental conflicts of the early 1970s, as Noonan notes, “corporations and environmentalists were butting heads, but we knew the free-enterprise system was a fantastic motivator. So the Conservancy decided to reach out to corporate America. No other environmental group was doing it.” This operational strategy was augmented with a new mission state­ment from Bob Jenkins, The Nature Conservancy’s in-house biologist. Dissatisfied with <u>the Conservancy</u>’s acceptance of land with dubious ecological worth, although it often appeared to be undisturbed as natu­ral scenery, Jenkins <u>saw <r class="highlighted">biodiversity rather than natural appearance</r> as that quality which TNC should be preserving</u>.31 Instead of protecting any and all land that it acquired, <u>Jenkins’s strategy stressed preserving only those lands populated by rare or endangered flora and fauna in <r class="highlighted">unique ecosystems. Scientific surveillance was combined with high-test property management</r></u> to give TNC a much clearer purpose. Noonan’s acceptance of corporate free enterprise and Jenkins’s <u>agen­das for surveying, inventorying, and guarding biotic diversity recentered The Nature Conservancy’s ideologies and institutions</u> on the strategies they continue to follow today. Grove concludes: The Nature Conservancy would henceforth seek out and attempt to save species and biotic communities that stood in danger of disappearing under human pressures. It would buy land when necessary, but to cut down on management and overhead costs, property was often turned over whenever possible to responsible federal and state agen­cies for protection. Further, TNC would decentralize, establishing state field offices that could keep closer watch on the land. Coinciding with its new focus, the national staff grew out of its basement quarters in Washington and moved just across the Potomac River into a high rise office building in Rosslyn, Virginia. Emerging as well in the months and years that followed were the practical arguments for maintaining biotic diversity. . . . Although morals and aesthetics still apply, the emphasis turned to “save this plant because we may need it someday” instead of “save this plant because we have no right to kill it.” Over the past two decades, TNC has grown by leaps and bounds by sticking to the operating objectives in this “preserving biodiversity” mis­sion statement. <u>Because Nature has ended, material signs of its now-dead substance need to be conserved as pristine preserved parts</u>, like pressed leaves in a book, dried animal pelts in a drawer, or a loved one’s mortal remains in a tomb. <u>Nature is dead, but long shall <r class="highlighted">Nature live in the environmental­ized forms of rare species, exotic biodiversity</r></u>, land preserves, <u><r class="highlighted">and threat­ened ecosystems</r></u>. As powerful anthropogenic actions have recontoured the earth to suit the basic material needs of corporate modes of produc­tion, these artificial contours now define new ecologies for all life forms caught within their “economy” and “environment.” <u>The “economy” be­comes a world political economy’s interior spaces defined by techno­science processes devoted to production and consumption, while “the environment</u>,” in this sense, <u>becomes a planetary <r class="highlighted">political economy’s ex­terior spaces oriented to resource creation</r></u>, scenery provision, <u>and waste reception</u>. The <u>pickets and suits deployed by</u> other more vocal <u>ecological groups</u> perpetuate a faulty one-dimensional consciousness, “believing that environmental protection and economic growth are somehow mu­tually exclusive.”33 These antiquated perceptions <u>cling to the illusion that Nature is alive, and somehow avoiding its subjection to capital in the commodity form by remaining wilderness</u>. Recognizing the true to­tality of <u>transnational capital’s power</u>, which <u>easily commodifies wilder­ness in many environmental products</u>, the goal of “The Nature Conser­vancy is to change this unfortunate perception,” because, as anyone at­tentive to capital’s dynamics can attest, “our economy and environment are not antagonists, they depend on each other. ... protecting our natu­ral resources generates economic benefits.”34 Natural resources exist, but Nature does not. Economic survival is imperative, but the commodity logics driving it need to be grounded in sound ecological common sense lest the limitless dynamism of com­modification be permitted to submit everything to exchange logics im­mediately. Time is now what is both scarce and centrally important in the highly compressed time-space continua of contemporary commod­ity chains. It is no longer a question of jobs versus the environment, be­cause fewer jobs will not resurrect Nature. Nature is dead, and the envi­ronment generating global production assumes that jobs are necessary to define it as the space of natural resources. Doing jobs irrationally and too rapidly, however, is what destroys these environments, making jobs done rationally and at an apt pace ecologically acceptable. Consequently, the agendas of environmental protection must center on the “question of the short-term vs. the long-term,” and this is “what the Conservancy is all about.”35</p><br> <br> Card Number: 11<br> <br><h4>Bioterror discourse is imagined, and leads to war </h4><p><strong>Kittelsen, 9</strong> – Researcher for the Security programme @ the International Peace Research Institute in Oslo (Sonja, “Conceptualizing Biorisk: Dread Risk and the Threat of Bioterrorism in Europe,” Security Dialogue vol. 40, no. 1, February)</p><p>The dread <u>that the prospect of <r class="highlighted">bioterrorism</r> elicits thus not only <r class="highlighted">compounds</r> the distinction between actual and <r class="highlighted">imagined threat</r></u><r class="highlighted">,</r> but also challenges the conventional spatio-temporal relationship between <u>‘threat’ and ‘<r class="highlighted">security’</r>, in that it <r class="highlighted">reinforces a</r> sense of <r class="highlighted">imminence and pervasiveness</r> of possible <r class="highlighted">attack.</r></u> Its imperceptible nature means that <u>insecurity can exist independent of an actual attack occurring, <r class="highlighted">the mere threat of infection</r> and contagion carrying the capacity to <r class="highlighted">evoke a heightened sense of fear</r> <r class="highlighted">long before</r> and well after <r class="highlighted">an attack</r> has been identified as ever having taken place. In the absence of fact about a threat that <r class="highlighted">deliberately evades detection</r>, the demand on governments to act proactively has become all the more salient, and providing for security has taken a precautionary turn.

They constitute an attempt at rearticulating the boundary between ‘secure’ and ‘insecure’ space through the active act of anticipation. Inherent in such an anticipatory logic, however, is an in-built vulnerability, in that this logic is necessarily informed by the subjective insecurities that the threat of bioterrorism elicits. <r class="highlighted">It simultaneously functions within and constitutes a product of the dread that the threat of bioterrorism</r> evokes, and accordingly does not so much serve to reduce the threat of bioterrorism as it serves to mitigate the effects of what is considered an inevitable occurrence.

This article argues that it is by conceptualizing bioterrorism through the notion of ‘<r class="highlighted">dread risk’</r> that this <r class="highlighted">self-perpetuation of vulnerability and threat can be exposed</r> and the necessary inroads provided by which to engage more critically with the threat of bioterrorism, its produc- tion and perpetuation, as well as with the constitution of ‘security’ itself.</u></p><br> <br> Card Number: 12<br> <br><h4>The aff’s rhetoric of China as the enemy is telling of a self-fulfilling prophecy of societal failure in the US</h4><p>Niv <strong>Horesh</strong> <strong>and</strong> Lim Kean <strong>Fan</strong>, May <strong>2017</strong>, “<em>The "China Model" as a Complicated Developmental Trope</em>,” Project Muse, China: An International Journal, vol. 15 no. 2 pg. 166-176, muse.jhu.edu/article/661224, Niv Horesh (Niv.Horesh@durham.ac.uk, corresponding author) is Visiting Professor in China Studies at the School of Government and International Affairs, Durham University, United Kingdom.

Evidence to that effect <r class="highlighted">can be found</r> not merely <r class="highlighted">in</r> Brook’s litanies about the <r class="highlighted">loss of American dynamism</r> and the bumbling of the Barack Obama administration. </u><r class="font4">More importantly, a growing body of academic literature has accumulated over the last few years to underscore how grossly unequally distributed income has become in the West. Many economists, not just on the far left, now indict the Ronald Reagan– Margaret Thatcher project of neo-liberalism for reversing the great post-war baby boomers’ march towards equal opportunity. </r><u>Inequality seers like Paul Krugman, Joseph Stiglitz, Thomas Picketty or Luigi Zingales may not necessarily agree about the health of the Chinese economy per se, but they certainly share a platform when it comes to inveighing against the godfathers of financial deregulation</u><r class="font4">, which they see as the underlying cause of America’s post-2008 recession.13 To be sure, there has always been critical interest among American academe in the failings of the “system”, and in democratic “optimisation” of economic outcomes. Buchanan and Tullock’s pioneering 1962 work on public choice is a case in point. They sought a free-market-friendly mathematical formula that would curb the ability of vested-interest groups to bypass the will of the silent majority through, for example, “pork-barrelling” swing voters or “lobbying” career politicians. However, in the 1960s, even studies such as Buchanan and Tullock’s were informed by the “genius” of America’s founding fathers and its 1787 Constitution,14 whereas many commentators of different partisan persuasions today view the Constitution itself, if not the Union’s whole political architecture, as anachronistic and unfit for the purpose in that they paralyse decisionmaking in Washington.15 </r><u>In search of new answers, <r class="highlighted">the insecurity premise</r>, as discussed earlier, <r class="highlighted">has resurrected</r> interest in the once-marginalised, <r class="highlighted">“heterodox” economic theories</r>, ranging from Mancur Olson, Hyman Minsky, Wolf Ladejinsky, Karl Polanyi to John K. Galbraith. All heterodox thinkers shared, in their time, deep-seated suspicion of the ability of free markets or representative democracy for that matter, to pre-empt the harbingers of resource misallocation. In other words, they rejected in one way or another neoclassical economic theory.</u><r class="font4"> As has been argued elsewhere, this disillusionment with neoclassical diktat has also led to renewed interest in the lessons that economic history, economic sociology and new institutional economics might offer, thus revitalising these three disciplines.16 Recent historically informed work by economists is now almost de rigueur and has gone well beyond the left-leaning circles. Taking issue with the root causes of the 2008 global financial crisis, such work—ranging from Reinhart and Rogoff’s rightleaning This Time is Different to Acemoglu and Robinson’s more centrist Why Nations Fail—harks back to several centuries earlier in its temporal scope. At the same time, older work by contrarian economic historians and economists that has been somewhat neglected in the 1980s, when neo-liberalism was fast advancing, found new readers among conventionally trained economists—from Paul Bairoch, Chalmers Johnston to Alice Amsden. Also, authors outside academe like Joe Studwell draw on that onceneglected work and converge on the view that the East Asian experience belies neoliberalism and exposes the small-government biases thereof.17 Freshly published, Studwell’s path-breaking and quantitatively-compelling research in economic history is further validating his insights. Allen and Lind have both respectively shown, for example, that unfree-market, big-government designs had not only typified the East Asian path to industrialisation. In fact, such grand design could also be attributed to America’s rise in the early 19th century. </r><u>Baldly put, Allen, Lind and others argue that <r class="highlighted">wealthier countries start preaching to poorer countries about the need for free trade</r> (read: reduce tariffs designed to protect nascent industries) <r class="highlighted">and the need to reduce government size</r> (read: allow foreigners to buy out vital sectors of the national economy) <r class="highlighted">only after they themselves had completed industrialisation on the back of very protectionist measures</r>.</u><r class="font4">18 </r><u>For these reasons, the human rights discourse in the modern developed world is critiqued by scholars like Noam Chomsky, Daniel A. Bell and Martin Jacques as a values-laden, ahistorical sugarcoating of what is, in essence, crude economic interests of/in advanced capitalist countries. Much like “free markets” in neoclassical parlance, human rights are conceived of as bringing about immediate betterment of the human condition irrespective of time and place, whereas in the Chinese narrative “individual” rights and “markets” are both viewed as contingent on “collective will” and on evolutionary social reform</u><r class="font4">. Yet, as Stiglitz alluded to, the wealthier “collectivist” China becomes, the harder it is to shrug off its affinity with the “individualistic” United States. </r><u>While, on the right, some <r class="highlighted">Western critics still cling to democracy-vs.-tyranny binary</r>, and on the left, some critics starkly posit the American neo-imperialism vs. China’s “peaceful rise” thesis, both contending powers are in fact experiencing flagrantly unequal wealth distribution—they are both big polluters, big military spenders, capital-punishment enthusiasts; and they also incarcerate big segments of their population.</u><r class="font4">19 Perhaps more importantly, not only are their logics of socio-economic regulation increasingly more similar to each other, they are now more economically interdependent than at any other point in history.20 Much of the self-doubt in America as well as the newfound interest in institutional economics, have, after all, to do with the fact that the “one man, one vote” system proved incapable of stalling the reversal of the post-war social contract in the West, which had in turn stamped out the spread of communism. Ironically, as Picketty poignantly shows, once the spectre of communism had diminished, inequality exploded.21 Recent works are very important in this context because they show—based on independently gathered polling data—that the absence of “one man, one vote” in China is not yet costing the CPC much popular support. Peerenboom, in particular, does much to dispel the fairly common Western notion that the peoples of the developing world would prefer a greater degree of democracy and social equality to raising of living standards in absolute terms.22 The argument, to be sure, might hold well beyond China. </r><u>It specifically brings to mind Latin America: while that part of the world democratised relatively recently, in some cases following decades of oppressive dictatorship, most Latin Americans still seem to prize economic performance over universal suffrage. Moreover, a few democratically elected Latin American governments have arguably taken social inequality well beyond the norm under their dictatorial predecessors.</u><r class="font4">23 US-based academics like Pei Minxin and Huang Yasheng often invoke India by way of an inspiration for the developing world that is alternative to the “China Model”; one that is more democratic and therefore one that would prove more economically compelling in the long run.24 After all, India is the biggest and one of the longestrunning democracies in Asia. </r><u>However, as Drèze and Sen’s work indicates, the fact that the Gini coefficient for supposedly-communist China may now be higher than that of India conceals the tough everyday realities that the overwhelmingly rural populations of either country face.</u><r class="font4"> For Drèze and Sen, perhaps more instructive is the fact that Chinese economic reforms of the last three decades did not whittle away at arable land distribution. In India, by way of contrast, arable land distribution remains badly skewed despite Nehru’s socialist legacy.25 What this points to, then, is </r><u><r class="highlighted">the need for any transfers of concrete policies and regulatory ideologies</r></u><r class="font4">—in particular that of the supposedly superior neoliberal reason—</r><u><r class="highlighted">to be contextually and historically grounded</r></u><r class="font4">. </r></p><br> <br> Card Number: 13<br> <br><h4>The fear of China as the Other in their rise is a self-fulfilling prophecy that takes out the aff </h4><p>Chengxin <strong>Pan</strong>, <strong>2012</strong>, “<em>Knowledge, Desire and Power in Global Politics</em>,” Edward Elgar Publishing, Inc., pg. 84-86, Pan is the Associate Professor of International Relations at Deakin University.

Similar to his own wounds, someone must have been responsible for his blindness, Inman wonders. To Inman’s surprise, however, the street vendor says he was actually born that way. Looking at his terrible wounds at the hands of known enemies, Inman somehow starts to pity that blind man. ‘</r><u>For how did you find someone to hate for a thing that just was?

To that blind man, knowing no enemy denies him that precious sense of certainty or a clear target for revenge. </r><u>With his known enemy, the lucky Inman is in good company. In many ways, <r class="highlighted">the military-industrial complex finds</r> itself in a similar situation, but <r class="highlighted">its lucky star is the perceived</r> certain <r class="highlighted">threat of China. Without</r> knowing this <r class="highlighted">threat</r>, the high-level military <r class="highlighted">spending would be difficult to justify</r>, and <r class="highlighted">without</r> that military <r class="highlighted">spending, the</r> political <r class="highlighted">economy of fear could not function</r> properly, nor could military Keynesianism continue to flourish.</u><r class="font4"> This is why Richard N. Haass, President of the Council on Foreign Relations and former Director of Policy Planning in the US State Department, observes that having survived decades of the Soviet challenge, </r><u>containment might not be able to survive its own success.</u><r class="font4"> 4 While the lack of an enemy—real or imagined—appears costly indeed for the discursive identity and institutional ‘survival’ of the militaryindustrial complex, </r><u>I contend that having an enemy, even an imagined one, is by no means cost-free. In fact, <r class="highlighted">in the case of China,</r> it could be very costly in that <r class="highlighted">the construction</r> and treatment of China <r class="highlighted">as a threat could result in China becoming one in reality</r>. In other words, the cost lies in the fact that the ‘China threat’ paradigm could become self-fulfilling in practice. To the military-industrial complex, the absence of a threat/enemy constitutes an ultimate threat. </u><r class="font4">A self-fulfilling prophecy, according to American sociologist Robert Merton, means that ‘a false definition of the situation which makes the originally false conception come true’.5 What is ‘false’ in hindsight or in the eyes of a bystander is frequently defined as real by the actor in question; and ‘if men define situations as real, they are real in their consequences’. 6 </r><u><r class="highlighted">In international relations, fear</r>, often based on ‘false’ images, <r class="highlighted">can have</r> precisely <r class="highlighted">such self-fulfilling consequences</r>.</u><r class="font4"> Thucydides, the author of a realist ‘great text’ History of the Peloponnesian War, noted a self-fulfilling prophecy of fear in interstate politics. In his account for the war’s outbreak, Thucydides suggested that ‘What made war inevitable was the growth of Athenian power and the fear which this caused in Sparta’.7 More than two millennia later, another realist scholar-practitioner, George Kennan ascribed the origin of the Cold War to the paranoid ideology of the Soviet Union.8 </r><u>If so, the fear manifested in the ‘China threat’ paradigm could also become confirmed in reality. Two interrelated processes are at play here. First, the ‘China threat’ paradigm, taken as objective truth, would imply the need for containing China in practice. Second, such practice, given the logic of mutual responsiveness, is more likely than not to be mirrored back by China in either symmetric or asymmetric ways. As the latter’s hardline mimicry apparently ‘confirms’ the initial fear of the China threat, what we are witnessing is a classic case of self-fulfilling prophecy. </u></p><br> <br> Card Number: 14<br> <br><h4>The fear of China comes from a neocolonial desire – such rhetoric is made to produce an economy of fear causing ontological death </h4><p>Chengxin <strong>Pan</strong>, <strong>2012</strong>, “<em>Knowledge, Desire and Power in Global Politics</em>,” Edward Elgar Publishing, Inc., pg. 66-69, Pan is the Associate Professor of International Relations at Deakin University.

Rather than divorced from power, they are always in the service of power and at the same time (re)produced by it through the political economies of fear and fantasy</u><r class="font4">. How knowledge, desire, and power interact in the cases of these China paradigms will be the focus of Chapters 4-7. Thus far, scholarly analysis of Western representations of China has tended to treat those representations merely as knowledge, which is then empirically evaluated against so-called ‘objective facts’ in China. Depending on whether they are thought to match Chinese reality or not, they are labelled either ‘truth’, ‘misrepresentations’, or something in between. But this empirically-grounded approach misses a crucial point. That is, it leaves intact and unquestioned the complicity of China knowledge in power relations. What is needed, therefore, is a critical examination of the power/knowledge nexus in the two modes of China representation. How the ‘China threat’ paradigm relates to the political economy of fear and informs political practice is the focus of this and the following chapter. And Chapters 6 and 7 will deal with the ‘China opportunity’ paradigm. </r><u>To better understand the dynamics of power/knowledge/<r class="highlighted">desire in the ‘China threat’ paradigm</r>, we need to recognise this paradigm for what I think it <r class="highlighted">is</r>, namely, a particular form of desire—<r class="highlighted">fear</r>—disguised as certain knowledge</u><r class="font4">. Fear, it may be argued, is primarily a biological instinct inherent in probably all animals that are both capable of fear and have experienced such an emotion. And yet, </r><u>in the human context at least, fear is as much a sociocultural phenomenon as it is a natural, biological reflex. This is because <r class="highlighted">most forms of fear</r> in modern society are not experienced directly through actual physical encounters, but rather <r class="highlighted">are created</r>, mediated, maintained and reinforced through often-institutionalised knowledge resources such as images, symbols, metaphors and, above all, discourses</u><r class="font4">. Sometimes referred to as ‘prevailing danger codes’, those knowledge resources serve as ‘an extremely dense layer of mediation between what one might be advised to fear… and what one’s moment-to-moment experience appears to be’.3 In a study of the politics of fear in the media, David Altheide argues that fear ‘did not just happen or emerge’ from uncertainty, the lack of community or a sense of lack of control over our lives; rather, it is largely produced and reproduced through ‘the entertainment formats of mass media and popular culture’. Only through coming to grips with this culturally-mediated dimension of fear, can we better understand why one’s sense of fear is often not directly or proportionally linked to the object of that fear. 4 In fact, quite often the opposite is true. </r><u>For instance, Altheide points to the paradox that ‘<r class="highlighted">there is</r> widespread public <r class="highlighted">perception [in the West</r>] that risk and danger are everywhere, <r class="highlighted">that we are not safe</r>, and that the future is bleak’, <r class="highlighted">even though</r> most in <r class="highlighted">Western societies ‘are</r> safer, healthier, living longer, and <r class="highlighted">more secure in their environments</r> than virtually any population in history’.5 How is such a strange ‘surplus’ of fear produced and consumed in an otherwise reasonably safe and wealthy society?</u><r class="font4"> Michael Shapiro suggests that the increased level of popular representation in the political process has not been matched by a similar increase in people’s ability to represent safety and danger as they find them in their daily lives. </r><u>6 Rather, just as more and more supermarket products nowadays are no longer made locally, so too the ‘commodity’ of <r class="highlighted">fear is increasingly outsourced</r> from elsewhere, manufactured and packaged as knowledge by all sorts of security, intelligence, health and environment experts</u><r class="font4">. And just as consumers part company with their money in exchange for whatever fantasies are evoked by commercial advertisements, </r><u><r class="highlighted">consumers of fear surrender their power</r> to scaremongering experts and political leaders, in exchange for the promised certainty and security</u><r class="font4">. In return, through their knowledge of danger and threat, those experts and politicians gain trust, power, and the ability to influence others to behave in ways that meet their expectations. In this way, whatever form of knowledge that can effectively tap into fear and constantly reproduce it is, without doubt, ideally placed to serve power and enforce discipline. Little wonder that the discursive production of fear and threat has been a fixture in modern-day politics. In Australia, no recent federal elections were complete without some forms of politics of fear at play in the political campaigns, be it about ‘boat people’, terrorism, workers’ rights or even interest rates. Of course, fear is not always an undesirable element in politics and social life. Moïse argues that ‘an element of fear is an indispensable protection against the danger of overconfidence. Fear is a force for survival in a naturally dangerous world’.7 </r><u><r class="highlighted">The ‘China threat’</r> paradigm should be understood in this broad context. This paradigm <r class="highlighted">does not reflect a pre-existing</r> sense of <r class="highlighted">fear</r> about a menace ‘out there’, <r class="highlighted">but rather</r> is a discursive site where such fear <r class="highlighted">is</r> first <r class="highlighted">constructed</r> and where a particular form of political economy of fear emerges.</u><r class="font4"> With a specific focus on the US, this chapter will examine how the China threat knowledge, which gives the popular fear of China an aura of objective credibility, serves the political and economic interests of the power elite, and is at the same time shaped by those interests. However, when fear is systematically deployed in politics, it is worth asking whose interests this fear politics intends to serve and how such fear is produced and for what purposes. THE CHINA THREAT AND AMERICAN POLITICAL ECONOMY OF FEAR </r><u>The political economy of fear has been a much-cherished ingredient in statecraft for millennia. ‘<r class="highlighted">Let them hate as long as they fear’</r>, the Roman emperor Caligula once proclaimed</u><r class="font4">. ‘[I]t is far better to be feared than loved if you cannot be both’, admonished Machiavelli in The Prince. </r><u>8 Thus, Robert Higgs argues that fear is a foundation of every government’s power: ‘Without popular fear, no government could endure for more than twenty-four hours’</u><r class="font4">.9 While the state has traditionally relied on such visible instruments of fear as the army, the police, the legal system, and the prison to maintain discipline in a society, </r><u>it has also resorted to a less visible instrument: the discursive production of fear. <r class="highlighted">One</r> particularly <r class="highlighted">fertile ground for</r> such <r class="highlighted">fear</r>related knowledge <r class="highlighted">production has been</r> the realm of <r class="highlighted">international relations</r>, where the objects of fear appear plentiful.</u><r class="font4"> The French political philosopher Jean Bodin observed that ‘the best way of preserving a state, and guaranteeing it against sedition, rebellion, and civil war is… to find an enemy against whom they can make common cause’.10 </r><u>Similarly, Adam Smith examined in The Wealth of Nations how a government could use the nation’s anxiety for security to induce its citizens to agree to a new tax which otherwise they would probably resent</u><r class="font4">.11 </r><u><r class="highlighted">It is in this context that the fear of the China threat has been a recurring feature in American politics</r> in general and during the presidential and congressional midterm elections in particular.</u><r class="font4"> During the 2010 midterm elections, for instance, New York Times reported that in a space of just one week, at least 29 candidates from both sides of politics unveiled advertisements accusing their opponents of being soft on China, with the undertone that China had been the chief villain for current American economic woes. </r><u>Such is the political economic use of fear especially when it is disguised as scientific knowledge.</u></p><br> <br> Card Number: 15<br> <br><h4>Prior commitment to Chinese threat perception makes their impacts inevitable –commitments to war collapse chances at peace </h4><p>Chengxin <strong>Pan</strong>, Department of Political Science and International Relations, Faculty of Arts, at Deakin University, August <strong>2004</strong>, Discourses Of ‘China’ In International Relations: A Study in Western Theory as (IR) Practice, p. 141-142</p><p>These are some of the questions in the minds of Western/American strategic analysts, who are wondering how to maintain U.S. preponderance in a world of anarchy and uncertainty. The conservative realist Samuel Huntington asks: “If being an American means being committed to the principles of liberty, democracy, individualism, and private property, and if there is no evil empire out there threatening those principles, what indeed does it mean to be an American, and what becomes of American national interests?”  <u>Obsessed with this <r class="highlighted">self-imagery</r>, many <r class="highlighted">scholars and policy planners</r> have been keen to reinvoke the timeless, structural certainty of geopolitical rivalry, and to embrace the ‘<r class="highlighted">back to the future’ scenario,</r> maintaining that despite the dawn of the post-Cold War period little has changed—the world remains a dangerous, volatile place.  With such searching eyes for an enemy, it would be surprising if China failed to come into view. Indeed, <r class="highlighted">China</r> makes a perfect candidate, in that “China <r class="highlighted">remains the major source of uncertainty</r> in the Asia-Pacific</u>.”  That is, not only do the implications of its economic transformation and military ambition remain unclear, but the resilience of the Communist government even after its roundly condemned Tiananmen suppression seems also to fly in the face of the ‘End of History’ triumphalism. Consequently, (and before September 11), the only major certainty coming out of the post-Cold War era seems to be an unpredictable and dangerous China. From the beginning<u>, <r class="highlighted">this ‘China threat</r>,’ I suggest, <r class="highlighted">is not a result of its actual challenge to the</r> West or the <r class="highlighted">U</r>nited <r class="highlighted">S</r>tates per se, <r class="highlighted">but</r> primarily <r class="highlighted">a discursive dimension of the neorealist construction</r> of the <r class="highlighted">America</r>n self in terms of global supremacy</u> and indispensable leadership. As Huntington makes it clear, “Chinese hegemony will reduce American and Western influence [in Asia] and compel the United States to accept what it has historically attempted to prevent: domination of a key region of the world by another power.” In the absence of such self-fashioning, most of China’s neighbours, which might arguably be more vulnerable to a China threat if there is one, have traditionally adopted a much less alarmist view on the ‘Middle Kingdom.’ Thus, <u>China’s real challenge for America</u>, as Yu Bin notes, “<u>is perhaps more psychological and conceptual—that is, how to deal with a major power whose rise is not necessarily guided by Washington,</u> unlike the post-World War II rise of Japan and Germany.”  Also, it can be argued that <u><r class="highlighted">the existence of an ‘enemy</r>’ is indispensable to the continued imagination of the ‘indispensable nation.</u>’ In Charles Frazier’s novel Cold Mountain, Inman, a soldier returning home from battle during the American Civil War, pondered the question: “What is the cost of not having an enemy?” Such a cost, then, seems very high indeed, for at stake here is what is seen as the ‘fundamental’ modern Western/American self-identity as a (global) rational being and indispensable leader. Heroic leadership would not be so needed if there was little left to fight for. Clearly mindful of this, Georgi Arbatov, Director of Moscow’s Institute for the Study of the USA and Canada, told a U.S. audience the year before the collapse of the Berlin Wall: “We are going to do something terrible to you—we are going to deprive you of an enemy.”  While he correctly noted that for the U.S. to live without an identity-defining enemy is terrible indeed, Arbatov was only half right, for the ‘enemy’ itself often has no control over its status as an enemy. Rather, as noted before, <u>it <r class="highlighted">is primarily a ready-made discursive category</r> built into the American self-imagination. With this discursive category as the analytical framework for understanding other actors on the world stage, Western and particularly American scholars did not simply ‘discover’ <r class="highlighted">a China threat</r> out there; it <r class="highlighted">was cognitively constructed beforehand.</r> </u></p><br> <br> Card Number: 16<br> <br><h4>The affirmatives democratic rhetoric gives the false illusion of peace - it causes mobilization against anything as long as it is labeled totalitarian </h4><p>Mark <strong>Neocleous</strong>, Professor of Critique of Political Economy @ Brunel University (UK), editorial of <a href="http://www.radicalphilosophy.com/">Radical Philosophy</a>, <strong>2008 </strong>(“Critique of Security.” PG(s).

And yet they also claimed that since <u>we lived in an age of ‘permanent antagonism and conflict’</u> (with ‘no lasting abatement of the crisis’), as the NSC-68 put it-‘the smaller <u>the gap between peacetime and wartime purposes, the greater [is] the likely-hood that a successful military effort will be politically successful as well’</u>. NSC-20/1 noted that ‘<u><r class="highlighted">a democracy cannot effect, as the totalitarian state</r> sometimes does, a complete identification of its peacetime and war time objectives’, but nonetheless suggested that the US needed to ‘reduce as far as possible the gap between them’</u>.  Indeed, one Policy Planning Staff Memo of May 1948 suggested that <u>liberal <r class="highlighted">democracies had been ‘handicapped’</r> by  ‘attachment to the concept of a basic difference between peace and war’ and claimed that what was needed was the idea of ‘<r class="highlighted">political warfare’</r> as ‘the logical application Clausewitz in time of peace’</u>. NSC-20/1 thus cited Clausewitz’s claim that ‘<u>war is a continuation of policy, intermingled with other means’</u>.  The intent was clar: ‘the basic objective outlines…is one which would be valid for peace as well as fro war’. Or as NSC-68 put it: <u>the objectives of a society are equally valid and necessary for peace as well as for war’, and they are so because <r class="highlighted">the challenge of security</r> is one ‘whicch encompasses <r class="highlighted">noth peace and war’</r>. Hence it is ‘essential that this government formulate general objectives which are capable of sustained pursuit both in times of peace and in the event of war’. In other words, since the enemy is as much within as without, and since the objectives, fears, and insecurities running through <r class="highlighted">the body politic are present in times of both peace and war, the distinction between the two is,</r> in essence <r class="highlighted">obliterated.</r> War and politics become a unity, and <r class="highlighted">‘political warfare’ is set in place mobilizing</r> ‘all the means at a nation’s command’. I</u>n this sense, <u>the national security state sought to legitimize the exercise of war powers during periods of peace by transforming the concept of ‘peace’ as applied to liberal democracy. ‘Such as peace as the United States is experiencing is not a peace; it is in fact a war’. This transformation was effected through the notion of security, especially in its ideological circuit with emergency</u>. Herein lies a further reason to explain the emergence of ‘national security’ rather than ‘national defense’ beyond that discussed at the beginning of Chapter 3. As Eyal Weizman has noted, <u>the logic of ‘defence’ deals with war and seeks to constitute with borders and barriers a clear distinction between ‘inside’ and ‘outside’, between the territory within the state and that which is exterior to it. T<r class="highlighted">he logic of ‘security’,</r> on the other hand , <r class="highlighted">presupposes that the danger is already inside</r>, presented by a population in which the subverive elements exist…If defence engages directly with the concept of war, security engages with the temporarily ill-defined and spatially amorphous ‘conflict’ not only between societies, but within them as well.

In the United States, for example, tuberculosis was the number one killer while small pox, diphtheria, tetanus and other infectious diseases were prevalent. <u>Curative medicine, allied to <r class="highlighted">other biopolitica</r>l ‘social’ security strategies, transformed the morbidity <r class="highlighted">of western populations</r>, however, by virtually <r class="highlighted">eliminating</r> such <r class="highlighted">diseases</r></u><r class="highlighted">.</r> Consequently, an entirely different demographic of morbidity has emerged. <u>This new landscape is characterised by chronic rather than infectious diseases. Chronic diseases are in turn <r class="highlighted">distinguished by a variety of significantly different features from those which characterised infectious disease</r>. </u>These features include the following.  1. First, susceptibility to chronic illness is a universal among western populations. 2. Second, chronic illnesses are characterised by early onset.  3. Third, chronic illnesses are progressive.  4. Fourth, such illnesses become clinical explicit only at certain symptom thresholds; angina or heart attack signalling the presence, for example, of heart disease that has been developing for many years.  5. Fifth, chronic illnesses are multifactorial.  6. Sixth, differences between individuals are manifested by the rate at which such diseases progress rather than the bald presence or absence of the disease.  7. Seventh, the onset and rate of progress of chronic illness is a direct function of exposure to risk factors. <u>These in turn are very much a function of how lives are lived; ‘life styles’. Whereas infectious disease invited drug cures, chronic illnesses invite pre-emption and prevention together with medical campaigns aimed at changing life-styles, backed by widespread <r class="highlighted">use of surveillance</r> (or ‘screening’ in medical terms) and the statistical documentation of the incidence of disease distribution spatially as well as temporally. All these developments have in turn begun to be combined with the pervasive regulation and management of risk</u>, and the astonishingly greater resolution given to the analytic of risk which resonates throughout all aspects of western society. <u>Closely allied with the concern for risk factors arising from life-styles, is an intense individualisation and personalisation of medicine as well.</u> <u>Whereas Foucault spoke of the ways in which liberal biopolitical governmentality encouraged the development of the entrepreneurial self,</u> 53  the compression of morbidity witnesses the emergence of a self entrepreneurially responsibilised to secure its own health care<u>.  Such developments similarly also reflect the intense preoccupation in <r class="highlighted">military corporate and homeland security</r> domains with the same kinds of preoccupations and analytical devices allying screening and surveillance with distribution-patterning and risk analysis across mass populations locally as well as globally. The <r class="highlighted">biopoliticisation of security discourse</r> in these more traditional areas of security analysis also reflects amassive shift to pre-emptive and preventative strategies</u>. While we do not have the space to trace the connections, the correlation is no mere accident. Granted that both military and corporate strategies are driven by their own local and global dynamics, <u>their informationalisation and biologisation nonetheless also directly reflects these developments as well.

These advantages include (i) mobilising more political support and economic resources for addressing the AIDS pandemic at global and local levels, (ii) breaking the silence and stigma surrounding HIV/AIDS in many African, Asian and Latin American countries, (iii) politicising the central role of the security sector as a vector of the virus, and (iv) helping to override the legal constraints bearing on the production of affordable life-saving AIDS medicines – especially those imposed by the international regime protecting intellectual property rights (TRIPS), the provisions of which do not apply to cases of national security crises.55 <u>These goals do seem worth striving for, but they must also be reassessed in light of the biopolitical dimension to the securitization of AIDS identified above</u>. Foucault, after all, had been able to detect at least two <u><r class="highlighted">serious ethical dangers</r> historically accompanying the deployment of biopolitical strategies</u>, and both of these concerns can, to some extent, be shown to apply to the current securitization of HIV/AIDS as well.  3.1<u>. <r class="highlighted">Biological Racism</r></u> One such danger is that <u>historically biopolitical strategies have given rise to new instances <r class="highlighted">of mass dea</r>th heralded on the basis of biological criteria</u>. With hindsight it seems profoundly ironic that the European era of biopower – advanced in the name of ‘life’ – coexisted with political strategies demanding the deaths of millions. <u>Foucault later came to understand this bizarre confluence on the basis of a new racism – a racism of biology rather than of culture</u>.56 ‘Racism’, he contended from a biopolitical perspective, ‘is primarily a way of introducing a break into the domain of life that is under power’s control: <u>the break between what must live and what must die.’57 <r class="highlighted">The Nazi movement</r> demonstrated this darker side of biopolitics</u> in a particularly stark manner when it carved up the European continent using the dubious criterion of ‘blood’ for deciding which populations could be usefully ‘Germanized’ and thus spared, and which ones could not.58 This biological racism was also projected internally to the Jewish population of the German <em>Reich</em>; Jews were no longer prosecuted solely because of their Judaism, but because of their ‘Jewishness’, which prompted Hannah Arendt to point out in her memorable phrase that whereas in the past ‘Jews had been able to escape from Judaism into conversion; from Jewishness there was no escape.’59 <u>A biopolitical society, in short, may still make decisions about whose life is worth preserving and whose life will be allowed to perish, and the function of racism in a biopolitical age is to make this very distinction</u>. Indeed, biological racism may even prove to be more pernicious than the traditional cultural racism precisely in that there is no escape from one’s biological makeup. <u>In either case, such biological racism can explain the historical irony that it was ‘as managers of life and survival, of bodies and the race</u>, that so many regimes have been able to wage so many wars, causing so many men to be killed’.60 This darker side of the twentieth century<u> European biopolitics, moreover, must give pause for thought regarding ongoing attempts to the frame the AIDS pandemic as an international security issue</u>. Is there any evidence of racism operating in the international debate on HIV/AIDS? <u>There is certainly evidence that the older, cultural racism is present in this debate</u>, especially regarding the question of which peoples are allowed to live and which ones are left to die. Given the existence of life-prolonging medicines, the pandemic could be significantly curtailed with sufficient international political will and resources. Yet Africans’ claims to these medicines are not being satisfied; the survival of these populations is being given much less priority internationally than say </p><br> <br> Card Number: 20<br> <br><h4>Economic collapse scenarios further societal militarization by connecting it to national security – that turns the case and perpetuates the international capitalist order</h4><p>Mark <strong>Neocleous,</strong> Professor of Critique of Political Economy at Brunel University (UK), 200<strong>8 </strong>(“Critique of Security.” Pg. 101-102. )</p><p><r class="font6">In other words, </r><u>the new international order moved very quickly to reassert <r class="highlighted">the connection between economic and national security</r>: the commitment to the former simultaneously a commitment to the latter, and vice versa.

A common activity pursued by academics specialising in food security is to debate the appropriate definition of the term; a study undertaken by the Institute of Development Studies cites over 200 competing definitions (Smith et al., 1992). </r><u>This</u><r class="font6"> pervasive predilection for empirical clarity </r><u><r class="highlighted">is symptomatic of</r> traditional <r class="highlighted">positivist epistemologies</r></u><r class="font6"> and constrains a more far-sighted understanding of the power functions of ‘food security’ itself, a conceptual construct now accorded considerable institutional depth.2 Bradley Klein contends that </r><u>to understand the political force of organizing principles like food security, </u><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">a shift of analytical focus is required</r></r><u><r class="highlighted">: ‘Instead of presuming their existence</r> and meaning, <r class="highlighted">we ought to historicize</r> and relativize <r class="highlighted">them</r> as sets of practices with distinct genealogical trajectories</u><r class="font6">’ (1994: 10). </r><u>The forthcoming analysis traces the emergence and evolution of food security discourse in official publications and interrogates the intertextual relations which pertain between these publications and other key sites of discursive change and/or continuity</u><r class="font6">. Absent from much (if not all) of the academic literature on food security is any reflection on the governmental content of the concept of ‘security’ itself. </r><u>The notion of food security is received and regurgitated in numerous studies which seek to establish a better, more comprehensive food security paradigm</u><r class="font6">. Simon Maxwell has produced more work of this type than anyone else in the field and his studies are commonly referenced as foundational to food security studies (Shaw, 2005; see Maxwell, 1990; 1991; 1992; 1996; Devereux &amp; Maxwell, 2001). Maxwell has traced the evolution in thinking on food security since the 1970s and distinguishes three paradigm shifts in its meaning: from the global/national to the household/individual, from a food first perspective to a livelihood perspective and from objective indicators to subjective perception (Maxell, 1996; Devereux &amp; Maxwell, 2001). There is something of value in the kind of analysis Maxwell employs and these three paradigm shifts provide a partial framework with which to compare the results of my own analysis of food security discourse. I suggest, however, that the conclusions Maxwell arrives at are severely restricted by his unwillingness to reflect on food security as a governmental mechanism of global liberal governance. As a ‘development expert’ he employs an epistemology infused with concepts borrowed from the modern development discourse; as such, his conclusions reflect a concern with the micro-politics of food security and a failure to reflect on </r><u>the macro-politics of ‘food security’ as a specific rationality of government</u><r class="font6">.  In his article ‘Food Security: A Post-Modern Perspective’ (1996) Maxwell provides a meta-narrative which explains the discursive shifts he distinguishes. He argues that the emerging emphasis on ‘flexibility, diversity and the perceptions of the people concerned’ (1996: 160) in food security discourse is consistent with currents of thought in other spheres which he vaguely labels ‘post-modern’. In line with ‘one of the most popular words in the lexicon of post-modernism’, Maxwell claims to have ‘deconstructed’ the term ‘food security’; in so doing, ‘a new construction has been proposed, a distinctively post-modern view of food security’ (1996: 161-162). This, according to Maxwell, should help to sharpen programmatic policy and bring theory and knowledge closer to what he calls ‘real food insecurity’ (1996: 156). My own research in the forthcoming analysis contains within it an explicit critique of Maxwell’s thesis, based on three main observations. First, Maxwell’s ‘</r><u>reconstruction’ of <r class="highlighted">food security</r> and re-articulation of its normative criteria <r class="highlighted">reproduce </r>precisely <r class="highlighted">the kind of </r>technical, <r class="highlighted">managerial</r> set of <r class="highlighted">solutions which characterise the positivistic need for</r></u><r class="font6"> definitional </r><u><r class="highlighted">certainty</r></u><r class="font6"> that he initially seeks to avoid. Maxwell himself acknowledges ‘the risk of falling into the trap of the meta-narrative’ and that ‘the ice is admittedly very thin’ (1996: 162-163), but finally prefers to ignore these misgivings when faced with the frightening (and more accurately ‘post-modern’) alternative. Second, I suggest that the third shift which Maxwell distinguishes, from objective indicators to subjective perceptions, is a fabrication which stems more from his own normative beliefs than evidence from official literature. To support this part of his argument Maxwell quotes earlier publications of his own work in which his definition incorporates the ‘subjective dimension’ of food security (cf. Maxwell, 1988). As my own analysis reveals, </r><u><r class="highlighted">while lip-service is occasionally paid to</r> the lives and faces of <r class="highlighted">hungry people, food security analysis is constituted by</r> increasingly extensive, technological and professedly ‘<r class="highlighted">objective’ methods of</r> identifying and <r class="highlighted">stratifying the ‘</r>food <r class="highlighted">insecure</r></u><r class="font6"><r class="highlighted">’</r>. This comprises another distinctly positivistic endeavour. Finally, Maxwell’s emphasis on ‘shifts’ in thinking suggests the replacement of old with new – the global/national concern with food supply and production, for example, is replaced by a new and more enlightened concern for the household/individual level of food demand and entitlements. Discursive change, however, defies such linear boundary drawing; the trace of the old is always already present in the form of the new. I suggest that Maxwell’s ‘shifts’ should rather be conceived as ‘additions’; the implication for </r><u><r class="highlighted">food security</r></u><r class="font6"> is an increasingly complex agenda, increasingly amorphous definitions and the establishment of new divisions of labour between ‘experts’ in diverse fields. This </r><u><r class="highlighted">results in</r> a </u><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">technocratic discourse</r></r><u> which ‘presents policy as if it were directly dictated by matters of fact</u><r class="font6"> (thematic patterns) </r><u>and deflects consideration of values choices</u><r class="font6"> and the social, moral </r><u>and political responsibility for such choices</u><r class="font6">’ (Lemke, 1995: 58, emphasis in original). The dynamics of technocratic discourse are examined further in the forthcoming analysis. These observations inform the explicit critique of contemporary understandings of food security which runs conterminously with the findings of my analysis. </r><u><r class="highlighted">I</r> adopt a broad perspective from which to <r class="highlighted">interrogate</r> </u><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">food security </r></r><u><r class="highlighted">as</r></u><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted"> a discursive technology of global liberal governance</r></r><u>.

In his first day in the White House, on January 22, 2009, Obama issued three executive orders that followed through on this promise.[2] In addition to these early executive orders, in the days and months following his election Obama showed great rhetorical sensitivity to the wide-spread negative perception in the Middle East of U.S. imperial behavior and designs, its uncritical support of Israel, and its disregard for civilian casualties and for the civil rights of prisoners. In an effort to reverse the tide of anti-American feeling, Obama's first post-inaugural interview was given to Hisham Melhem of Al Arabiya TV news (Interview). This was followed in April and May by major addresses in Ankara and Cairo whose primary intended audience was Middle Eastern and, more broadly, Islamic. Both of these speeches articulate a new rhetoric of hope for U.S.-Middle Eastern relations. In the speech to the Turkish parliament, for example, Obama declares:</r><r class="font6">¶</r><r class="font7"> I [...] want to be clear that America's relationship with the Muslim community, the Muslim world, cannot, and will not, just be based upon opposition to terrorism. We seek broader engagement based on mutual interest and mutual respect. We will listen carefully, we will bridge misunderstandings, and we will seek common ground. We will be respectful, even when we do not agree [...]. (para. 38)</r><r class="font6">¶</r><r class="font7"> Hope for a new era of U.S Middle East relations is here embodied by an attitude of respect, by a willingness to negotiate differences and find areas of mutual interest, and by an explicit criticism of the unilateral and monologic focus of the Bush administration on the 'war on terror'.</r><r class="font6">¶</r><r class="font7"> This apparent change in direction in national security and foreign policy seems to be characterized by an alternate version of presidential masculinity and by an alternate telling of the myth of American exceptionalism. Many have commented on the muscular character of George W. Bush's rhetoric of war and national security. Indeed, his policies in what he called the 'war on terror' depended almost exclusively on what Joseph Nye famously called "hard power", and were justified rhetorically by a conspicuously militarist and masculinist narrative about America's role in world history and politics.[3] In contrast to the "[...] stern projection of a tough national persona" (Ivie and Giner 288) in Bush's rhetoric and policies, </r><u><r class="highlighted">Obama</r> seems to articulate a gentler, more reasoned approach to national security</u><r class="font7"> and terrorism </r><u>that</u><r class="font7"> includes the use of 'hard' military power but also </r><u><r class="highlighted">depends</r> importantly <r class="highlighted">on 'soft' power in</r> the form of <r class="highlighted">diplomacy, international cooperation</r>, and an emphasis on human rights</u><r class="font7">, economic stability and political freedom. Ivie and Giner argue that </r><u>the success of <r class="highlighted">Obama's</r></u><r class="font7"> rhetorical </r><u><r class="highlighted">appeal to 'soft' power</r></u><r class="font7"> during the 2008 presidential campaign </r><u>was due to his ability to</u><r class="font7"> </r><r class="emphasis">harness and <r class="highlighted">resignify the deeply-resonant myth of American exceptionalism for a more democratic</r></r><r class="font7"> and community-minded </r><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">projection of America's role</r></r><r class="font7"> </r><r class="emphasis">in world affairs</r><r class="font7">. In Obama's version of national security, they write:</r><r class="font6">¶</r><r class="font7"> A less tragic sense of order mandated a reduced sense of guilt and thereby decreased the need for redemption via the cult of killing. This expression of national mission in more democratic and practical terms indicated, at least "logologically," the possibility of aligning public culture with a more global and constructive perspective on matters of national security. It revealed the possibility of a founding myth reformed to relax the lethal grip of the Evil One on the conscience of a nation that might do more good in the world if it were burdened less by tragic guilt.[4] (296)</r><r class="font6">¶</r><r class="font7"> This conclusion requires a retrospective reassessment in the light of Obama's decision to escalate the war in Afghanistan. </r><u>How do we reconcile Obama's seemingly dramatic shift from progressive</u><r class="font7"> presidential candidate </r><u>who</u><r class="font7"> was proud to have </r><u>opposed</u><r class="font7"> the war in </r><u>Iraq</u><r class="font7"> from the beginning, and who abolished the use of torture and illegal detention in his first day in office, </r><u>to the president who</u><r class="font7"> in December 2009 </r><u>made the decision to</u><r class="font7"> pursue and significantly </r><u>escalate</u><r class="font7"> military </r><u>violence in Afghanistan?</u><r class="font7"> How do we reconcile Obama's seemingly contradictory use of both the soft rhetoric of hope and diplomacy and the hard rhetoric of fear and military violence in his national security statements and speeches?</r><r class="font6">¶</r><r class="font7"> In the analysis that follows I argue that </r><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">while Obama</r></r><r class="font7"><r class="highlighted"> </r></r><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">at times articulates a softer</r> version of <r class="highlighted">foreign policy</r>,</r><r class="font7"> </r><r class="emphasis">and seems to perform a softer, more inclusive presidential masculinity in the area of global politics</r><r class="font7"> and terrorism, </r><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">this does not fundamentally signify a</r> <r class="highlighted">different orientation to national security</r></r><r class="font7"> as some have argued. </r><r class="emphasis">I emphasize how <r class="highlighted">Obama's rhetoric</r></r><r class="font7"> and policies </r><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">fall within the</r> standard rhetorical <r class="highlighted">oscillations that constitute the myth of</r> American <r class="highlighted">exceptionalism and presidential masculinity</r>, <r class="highlighted">and</r> that those oscillations <r class="highlighted">are</r> </r><r class="font7">principally and most significantly</r><r class="emphasis"> oriented by the more <r class="highlighted">militarist </r>and</r><r class="font7"> conventionally</r><r class="emphasis"> masculinist versions of the myth</r><r class="font7">.</r><r class="font6">¶</r><r class="font7"> Presidential Masculinity in the Democratic Nomination Speech</r><r class="font6">¶</r><r class="font7"> Obama's speech at the Democratic National Convention in August 2008 marks the formal shift of his campaign focus from Democratic Party voters towards a national audience, and from his rivalry with Hillary Clinton to a campaign against John McCain. In terms of Obama's national security rhetoric, this is a fascinating moment because, in this new broader context, he makes an attitudinal shift to a more militarized and masculinized mode of speech. In fact, Obama's performance of soft masculinity on issues of national security during the primary campaign was an opportune product of the moment that did not reflect the principal orientation of his thinking.[5] This is quite clear in the nomination speech as he shifts his campaign towards a more conservative national audience, and directs his attention from a female rival to a male rival with military credentials.</r><r class="font6">¶</r><r class="font7"> Obama's first sentence about foreign policy in the nomination speech concerns his own stature and ability to lead American troops into battle, and to battle John McCain for the position of commander in chief. "If John McCain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander-in-chief, that's a debate I'm ready to have." (para. 79) What is most interesting about this lead-in to the topic of national security, terrorism, and foreign policy is that its main rhetorical function is to emphasize Obama's masculine capability. It does this by declaring his presidential mettle, but also through the performance of an 'I dare you' challenge to his political adversary. It seems to say, 'if you want to fight, then let's fight. Bring it on!'</r><r class="font6">¶</r><r class="font7"> Why does Obama begin this section of the speech with a flexing of muscle? In part, it has to do with the histrionics of presidential campaigns, and in this particular campaign with the anticipated challenge to Obama's military masculinity from John McCain, a candidate with a powerful story of military bravery and heroism to his credit. At the same time, the foregrounding of presidential masculinity in terms of the resolve and capacity to lead the armed forces into battle is nothing unusual. The most significant human protagonist in the narrative of American exceptionalism is almost always the figure of </r><u>the president</u><r class="font7">. This is especially true in times of danger, crisis or war. He is the commander in chief of the armed forces. To him goes the job of protecting the national family from outside threats and danger. To do this effectively, he </r><u>must be brave, decisive and rational.</u><r class="font7"> He cannot afford to be feminized by being overly emotional or sympathetic to others; </r><u>he cannot</u><r class="font7"> succumb to doubts, or </r><u>become scared to act</u><r class="font7"> (Cohn, Cuordileone, Hopper, Lakoff, Sylvester, Tickner, Young). It is to this mythos that Obama's beginning performance of masculinity in the speech belongs. In the new context of a national audience, it stands out as a deeply-felt and vigorously articulated orientation towards national security.</r><r class="font6">¶</r><r class="font7"> After this initial show of male plumage, Obama continues the foreign policy section of the nomination speech by contrasting his youthful masculinity to McCain's elderly, bumbling masculinity.</r><r class="font6">¶</r><r class="font7"> For -- for while -- while Senator McCain was turning his sights to Iraq just days after 9/11, I stood up and opposed this war, knowing that it would distract us from the real threats that we face. When John McCain said we could just muddle through in Afghanistan, I argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11, and made clear that we must take out Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights. (para. 80-81)</r><r class="font6">¶</r><r class="font7"> While McCain turns his sights away from the target, Obama stands up. While McCain muddles, Obama works to finish the fight and "take out" bin Laden if he's "in our sights." In the subtly crafted metaphor of aiming a gun at an enemy that organizes the passage, McCain appears as a distracted old soldier who aims at the wrong target and is generally confused. In contrast, vigorous and youthful, Obama stands up purposely, aims at the target, and fires. These metaphors all work to highlight the differences between McCain and Obama in terms of their embodiment of a properly militarized masculinity: which candidate can stand up, correctly identify the enemy, and fire the necessary shots to kill him.</r><r class="font6">¶</r><r class="font7"> Obama criticizes McCain for standing alone in "stubborn refusal" to recognize the realities of the conflict (that it is with al Qaeda in Pakistan and Afghanistan, not in Iraq), and therefore for lacking judgment. This lack of judgment is also narrated in terms of a contrast between a youthful and an aging masculinity: "</r><u>We need a president who can face the threats of the future, not keep grasping at the ideas of the past."</u><r class="font7"> (para. 84) Obama declares. The contrast between a man who grasps at the past and one who "faces" the future is coded with messages about age and masculinity: youthful, confident stepping forward into the future versus old, unsteady back-stepping towards the past. At stake in this contrast is which strategy will "defeat" the enemy. "You don't defeat -- you don't defeat a terrorist network that operates in 80 countries by occupying Iraq", (para. 85) Obama argues. These are enemies who must be killed in order to protect the nation. </r><u>To do this requires a commander-in-chief with masculine resolve and courage who can lead us into battle</u><r class="font7">. This is not work for touchy-feely idealists who want to understand, communicate, and negotiate. And Republicans, Obama points out proudly, are not the only ones with the proper testicular size to lead the army into battle: "We are the party of Roosevelt. We are the party of Kennedy. So don't tell me that Democrats won't defend this country. Don't tell me that Democrats won't keep us safe." (para. 87) As in his opening statement, part of the effectiveness of these lines is their performance of a kind of "I'm up to the challenge masculinity" that talks tough, is aggressive with challengers ("don't tell me"), and does not back down. The rhetoric of American exceptionalism and presidential masculinity foregrounded here in the nomination clearly constitutes the dominant note of continuity in Obama's national security thinking. This is most evident in his two speeches from December 2009 in which he justifies his decision to escalate the war in Afghanistan as the following discussion will show.</r><r class="font6">¶</r><r class="font7"> Reasons for War: the December 1, 2009 Speech at West Point</r><r class="font6">¶</r><r class="font7"> Obama's December 2009 speech at West Point argues for the strategic necessity and ethical correctness of increased war effort in Afghanistan on the basis of history. The history begins with the 19 Al Qaeda operatives who committed the terrorist atrocities on 9/11 and moves quickly to focus on the Taliban who provided them with a secure base from which to operate. After 9/11, as Obama tells the story, we made great military inroads against the Taliban and Al Qaeda, but then mistakenly turned our attention to Iraq. This provided an opening for the Taliban, and for Al Qaeda, who are now coming back into Afghanistan from Pakistan. The Afghan government cannot fight them off and therefore, he says, summing it all up: "In short, the status quo is not sustainable" (para. 12). How does a rudimentary history like this serve as an explanation or justification for war? What is the mediating logic?</r><r class="font6">¶</r><r class="font7"> The over-simplification of contemporary U.S and Afghan history entailed in this schematic narrative is head-spinning.[6] But, even putting that aside, if one accepts the history at face value, it is still the case that our commitment to war is left unexplained and unjustified by the narrative. The history begins with 19 terrorists, and ends with the large-scale military action on the part of the United States. Should it not take a lot more than saying, 'well, the Taliban are gaining momentum and, remember, they are best friends with Al Qaeda' to justify the deployment of 100,000 U.S. troops, predator drones strikes all over northern Pakistan and eastern Afghanistan, full involvement of the CIA, major flows of capital and materiel, and huge contracts with private military contractors like XE Services (aka Blackwater)? Obama's historical narrative simply does not add up to a political argument for this kind of war, and for this kind of outlay of capital.</r><r class="font6">¶</r><r class="font7"> </r><u>As a justification for war, it seems, rather, to be structured like a myth</u><r class="font7"> in the sense that Roland Barthes gave the word. </r><u><r class="highlighted">Myth</r></u><r class="font7">, according to Barthes, is paradoxically effective because, formally, it </r><u><r class="highlighted">works like an alibi. </r></u><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">It is an explanation based on an absence of evidence</r> and meaning <r class="highlighted">rather</r> <r class="highlighted">than its presence</r>.</r><r class="font7"> In an alibi (the accused was absent not present at the scene) the meaning and the evidence are always elsewhere (121-127). </r><u>Obama's narrative amounts to a </u><r class="emphasis">mythological explanation for war</r><u> </u><r class="font7">in the sense that its significance lies not in the history itself but in the formal seriousness of a president telling a story to justify war. That is, its significance lies in the rhetorical gesture that serves to remind the audience of the president's authority as commander in chief and of his role to defend the nation from harm. By telling this story the president in effect quotes an array of motives, intentions, plot sequences and characters that are formally full even if their content in this instance is misleading or empty. To paraphrase Hayden White, in this case the content is the form. Here, the details of the story of the Taliban and Al Qaeda in Afghanistan are significant to the extent that they play a role in a larger narrative already familiar to the American audience: the Unites States stands for peace and prosperity, freedom and democracy but sometimes it is attacked by evil enemies whose irrational desire is to destroy all that is good. In that circumstance, the president must protect the national family through the use of military violence. War is the best and, in fact, the only way to make ourselves secure.</r><r class="font6">¶</r><r class="font7"> Following this schematic historical narrative with which he begins the West Point speech, Obama reassures the audience that his final decision to escalate the war was taken only after a serious and difficult deliberative process. This process, he says, "has allowed me to ask the hard questions, and to explore all the different options, along with my national security team, our military and civilian leadership in Afghanistan, and our key partners. And given the stakes involved, I owed the American people -- and our troops -- no less." (para. 13) </r><u>The image of the president very seriously asking questions, exploring options, and consulting experts is one intended to produce a sense of citizen confidence both in the decision and in the decider</u><r class="font7"> (as George W. Bush famously called himself) again without revealing any of the details or particulars that constitute the decision. The rhetorical appeal here is essentially charismatic and depends on thick cultural associations with the president as benevolent paternal authority, and as rational but determined protector of the nation. The tone of the passage is that of a father reassuring his family that the big decision he has made today was made with great care, and with their communal welfare in mind.</r><r class="font6">¶</r><r class="font7"> Obama's </r><u><r class="highlighted">stress on his</r> careful <r class="highlighted">deliberation process but not on the </r></u><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">content of the deliberation</r></r><r class="font7"> </r><u><r class="highlighted">is reminiscent of</r></u><r class="font7"> Iris Marion Young's emphasis on </r><u><r class="highlighted">the "logic of masculinist protection</r></u><r class="font7">" </r><u>in national security thinking</u><r class="font7">. </r><u>This is a logic that connects the protective role of the father in the patriarchal family with the role of commander in chief.</u><r class="font7"> In both cases, she argues that </r><u>one of the prices exacted by benevolent masculinist protection is that <r class="highlighted">the protected</r> woman/<r class="highlighted">feminized citizen must concede "</r>critical <r class="highlighted">distance from decision-making </r>autonomy</u><r class="font7">." (120). In other words, if the fatherly president's allegiance to citizens and soldiers is expressed in the mindfulness with which he makes communal decisions of this magnitude, then it is equally true that our allegiance to the father-president is expressed in our acceptance of his authority and judgment to do what is best for us in these circumstances. The allegiance to the father quickly becomes the measure of our patriotism. As a rhetorical strategy, then, Obama's description of the seriousness of his decision-making process serves to legitimate his decision to escalate war through an appeal to an image of protective presidential masculinity. This appeal interpellates the audience in the role of a complicit, feminized citizenry that needs such fatherly protection.[7]</r><r class="font6">¶</r><r class="font7"> After the scant historical review, and a summary of where we are and why we are obliged to go to war, Obama devotes a good portion of the West Point speech to making a series of sequential points, statements of fact, and reasoned arguments. For example, he gives three specific goals for the Afghan intervention, and outlines how those goals will be achieved and how it will all be paid for. He also identifies three possible objections to the escalation and gives reasoned arguments for why these criticisms are incorrect.

H. Remak Professor of Germanic Studies at Indiana University, Spring 2003, Cultural Critique, Vol. 54, p. 141-144</p><p>For Schmitt, to assume that one can derive morally correct political institutions from abstract, universal norms is to put the cart before the horse. <u><r class="highlighted">The</r> truly <r class="highlighted">important question remains:</r> <r class="highlighted">who decides</r>?</u> <a href="http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/cultural_critique/v054/54.1rasch.html#FOOT15">15</a> What political power representing <u><r class="highlighted">which political order defines terms like human rights</r> and public reason</u>, defines, in fact, <u><r class="highlighted">what it means to be</r> properly <r class="highlighted">human</r>?</u> <r class="font8">What political power distinguishes between the decent and the indecent, between those who police the world and those who are outlawed from it? Indeed, what political power decides what is and what is not political? Habermas's contention that normative legality neutralizes the moral and the political and that therefore Schmitt "suppresses" the "decisive point," namely, "the legal preconditions of an impartial judicial authority and a neutral system of criminal punishment" (1998, 200), is enough to make even an incurable skeptic a bit nostalgic for the old Frankfurt School distinction between affirmative and critical theory. One could observe, for instance, that </r><u><r class="highlighted">the "universality" of human rights has a very particular base</r></u><r class="font8">. As Habermas says:  Asiatic societies cannot participate in capitalistic modernization without taking advantage of the achievements of an individualistic legal order. One cannot desire the one and reject the other. From the perspective of Asian countries, the question is not whether human rights, as part of an individualistic legal order, are compatible with the transmission of one's own culture. Rather, the question is whether the traditional forms of political and societal integration can be reasserted against—or must instead be adapted to—the hard-to-resist imperatives of an economic modernization that has won approval on the whole. (2001, 124)  Thus, despite his emphasis on procedure and the universality of his so-called discourse principle, the choice that confronts Asiatic societies or any other people is a choice between cultural identity and economic survival, between, in other words, cultural and physical extermination. As Schmitt said, the old Christian and civilizing distinction between believers and nonbelievers (Gläubigern and Nicht-Gläubigern) has become the modern, economic distinction between "creditors and debtors" (Gläubigern and Schuldnern).  But while affirmative theorists like Habermas and Rawls are busy constructing the ideological scaffolding that supports the structure of the status quo, what role is there for the "critical" theorist to play? Despite the sanguine hopes of Hardt and Negri (2000) that "Empire" will all but spontaneously combust as a result of the irrepressible ur-desire of the multitude, can we seriously place our faith in some utopian grand alternative anymore, or in some revolutionary or therapeutic result based on the truth of critique that would allow us all, in the end, to sing in the sunshine and laugh everyday? Do, in fact, such utopian fantasies not lead to the moralizing hubris of a Rawls or a Habermas? </r><a href="http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/cultural_critique/v054/54.1rasch.html#FOOT16"><r class="font8">16</r></a><r class="font8"> In short, it is one thing to recognize the concealed, particular interests that govern the discourse and politics of human rights and quite another to think seriously about how things could be different, to imagine an international system that respected both the equality and the difference of states and/or peoples. Is it possible—and this is Todorov's question—to value Vitoria's principle of the "free circulation of men, ideas, and goods" and still also "cherish another principle, that of self-determination and noninterference" (Todorov 1984, 177)? The entire "Vitorian" tradition, from Scott to Habermas and Rawls, thinks not. Habermas, for instance, emphatically endorses the fact that "the erosion of the principle of nonintervention in recent decades has been due primarily to the politics of human rights" (1998, 147), a "normative" achievement that is not so incidentally correlated with a positive, economic fact: "In view of the subversive forces and imperatives of the world market and of the increasing density of worldwide networks of communication and commerce, the external sovereignty of states, however it may be grounded, is by now in any case an anachronism" (150). And opposition to this development is not merely anachronistic; it is illegitimate, not to be tolerated. So, for those who sincerely believe in American institutional, cultural, and moral superiority, the times could not be rosier. After all,</r> <u><r class="highlighted">when push comes to shove, "we" decide—not only about which societies are decent </r>and which ones are not<r class="highlighted">, but also about which acts of violence are "terrorist" and which compose the "gentle compulsion" of a "just war</r></u>."  What, however, are those "barbarians" who disagree with the new world order supposed to do? With Agamben, they could wait for a "completely new politics" to come, but the contours of such a politics are unknown and will remain unknown until the time of its arrival. And that time, much like the second coming of Christ, seems infinitely deferrable. While they wait for the Benjaminian "divine violence" to sweep away the residual effects of the demonic rule of law (Benjamin 1996, 248-52), the barbarians might be tempted to entertain Schmitt's rather forlorn fantasy of an egalitarian balance of power. Yet if the old, inner-European balance of power rested on an asymmetrical exclusion of the non-European world, it must be asked: <u><r class="highlighted">what new exclusion will be necessary for a new balance, and is that new exclusion tolerable</r>?</u> At the moment, there is no answer to this question, only a precondition to an answer. If one wishes to entertain Todorov's challenge of thinking both equality and difference, universal commerce of people and ideas as well as self-determination and nonintervention, then <u><r class="highlighted">the concept of humanity must once again become the invisible and unsurpassable horizon of discourse</r>, not its positive pole.

The record of the 1990s has left both Russia and the United States unsatisfied. </r><u><r class="highlighted">Russia looks back</r></u><r class="font4"> at the decade </r><u><r class="highlighted">with bitterness</r> and a feeling of being marginalized and slighted by the world’s sole remaining superpower</u><r class="font4">. It is also disappointed by its experience with Western-style reforms and mistrustful of American intentions. The United States is equally disappointed with Russia’s lack of focus, inability to engage effectively abroad, and failure to implement major reforms at home. A comprehensive partnership is out of the question. Renewed competition or active containment are also not credible as organizing principles. Russia’s economic, military and political/ideological weakness makes it an unlikely target of either U.S. competition or containment. Not only is Russia no longer a superpower, but its status as a regional power is in doubt. Current thinking about Russia is divided among four basic approaches: Forget Russia, Enfant Terrible Russia, Evil Russia, and Russia First. The Forget Russia view holds that Russia is too weak, too corrupt, and too chaotic to matter. After 10 years of trying to help Russia, the United States should focus its resources and attention on more deserving and important world issues. The Enfant Terrible view holds that, although Russia has been an irresponsible and irritating partner, it is too weak to hurt the United States and therefore need not be feared in earnest. President Vladimir Putin’s visits to Cuba and North Korea, courtship of Slobodan Milosevic, and welcoming of Iranian President Mohammad Khatami to Moscow are of little strategic consequence and thus not worth our attention. This view presupposes the existence of an important U.S.-Russian bilateral agenda and the need to protect it from childish and irresponsible Russian grandstanding. </r><u><r class="highlighted">The Evil Russia view</r> holds <r class="highlighted">that Russia</r>n courtship of Cuba, Iran, Iraq, and North Korea is a deliberate effort to <r class="highlighted">undermine U.S. influence</r> in the world and recreate the Soviet empire</u><r class="font4">. Analysts </r><u>embracing this view <r class="highlighted">take less notice of </r>Russia’s <r class="highlighted">diminished capabilities</r> than of ambitious rhetoric by Russian politicians</u><r class="font4">. Given Russia’s evil purposes, </r><u>the United States is already on a collision course with it and might as well do everything it can to box Russia in.</u><r class="font4"> The Russia First view holds that Russia still is the most important issue on the U.S. foreign policy agenda. It accepts the premise that the two sides have shared interests and that Russia, once reborn as a stable, prosperous democracy, can be a U.S. partner and ally. Therefore, the United States should actively assist Russia in its transformation and engage it in a broad and intense relationship with renewed vigor and creativity. There are shortcomings in all of these approaches. Notwithstanding its precipitous decline, to Forget Russia is clearly not an option: the country’s geographic expanse, nuclear arsenal, and proliferation potential simply make it impossible for U.S. policymakers to ignore. The Enfant Terrible view fails to take Russia seriously and ignores the very real problems that exist between the two countries. </r><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">The Evil Russia view risks inflating the threat and making</r> the myth of evil Russia <r class="highlighted">a self-fulfilling prophecy</r></r><r class="font4">. The Russia First view is </r><u><r class="highlighted">not grounded in reality</r></u><r class="font4">. After a decade of failure, it should be clear that </r><u>neither the specter of Russia’s past nor the promise of its future warrants a position near the top of the U.S. foreign policy agenda</u><r class="font4">. The Need for Normalcy Russia’s external weakness and internal problems have left the United States without an effective interlocutor, either as partner or competitor. Thus, the United States should deal with Russia on a case-by-case basis to advance our interests, in much the same way we deal with most other countries. This path will sometimes lead toward partnership with Russia and at other times toward competition. It may even result in a situation where Russia and the United States find themselves as partners and competitors simultaneously in different parts of the world or on different issues. Given its size, history, strategic nuclear capabilities, and future potential, one is tempted to overstate the importance of relations with Russia and put them at the top of the U.S. national security agenda. Except for geography and nuclear weapons, however, there is little at this stage to justify making relations with Russia a top priority. Undoubtedly, Russia can inflict unacceptable damage on the United States. </r><u>But <r class="highlighted">fear of Russia</r>n nuclear weapons should not be the driving element of the relationship. The hostility and ideological differences that <r class="highlighted">divide</r>d the super<r class="highlighted">powers</r> during the Cold War are gone. The <r class="highlighted">prospect of Russia consolidating</r> and rebuilding itself under a militant authoritarian, nationalist regime <r class="highlighted">is remote</r></u><r class="font4">. </r><u>Therefore, <r class="highlighted">fears of </r>a deliberate surprise <r class="highlighted">attack</r> on the United States <r class="highlighted">are unjustified</r></u><r class="font4">. Despite a number of bilateral undertakings outside the Cold War-style security agenda, ranging from regional diplomacy in the Balkans to investment, U.S. engagement with Russia, with the notable exception of the Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) Initiative, is limited. American investment in Russia is a fraction of what it is in Europe or China, trade rarely exceeds a few billion dollars a year, and political and cultural relations are limited at best. In other words, beyond traditional Cold War issues, the United States has an extremely narrow relationship with Russia, let alone enough of a stake in it to merit a special place on the U.S. foreign policy agenda. Nonetheless, while Russia is not a major player in Europe or Northeast Asia, its proximity to Europe, Japan, and China make it a focus of U.S. policy.</r></p><br> <br> Card Number: 30<br> <br><h4>Cold War perceptions of Russian decision making perpetuates conflict – casual relations spur escalation </h4><p>RICHARD <strong>SAKWA,</strong> expert in the field of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia">Russian</a> and Eastern European <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist">communist</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-communist">post-communist</a> politics, Professor of Russian and European politics at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Kent">University of Kent</a>, <strong>2008,</strong> “‘New Cold War’ or twenty years’ crisis?

Indeed, in some ways <r class="highlighted">Russia</r> could have <r class="highlighted">become the</r> natural <r class="highlighted">ally of America</r> and the EU on a range of questions</u><r class="font6">. So why have the differences become so sharp, and why has the whole architecture of post-commu- nist security arrangements been brought into question? In a rather schematic manner below I will suggest that t</r><u>here have been four major failures in adjusting policy to the new circumstances: political, strategic, intellectual and cultural. The key question is: How can we find our bearings in what we had assumed would be the post-Cold War era, to ensure that it is indeed the end of this particular global confrontation? <r class="highlighted">The political failure </r>There has been a profound asymmetry <r class="highlighted">in the transcendence</r> of the <r class="highlighted">Cold War</r>. While the structures that fought the Cold War (including the ideological ones) were dismantled on the one side, they were retained on the other. </u><r class="font6">The functions of bodies such as NATO have not been replaced by a common collective security regime, but instead have been strengthened and enlarged. Russia’s early enthu- siasm for the OSCE reflected the aspiration to create a genuine common security regime, but failed to take into account the asymmetrical end to the Cold War. The same applies to the ‘softer’ Cold War structures, including the whole ideological- security apparatus. These are active in </r><u>Washington and London, but in a different way no less alive in Moscow, and have been the easiest structures to revive in a renewed period of confrontation. The asymmetrical transcendence of the Cold War is accompanied by an internal asymmetry at the heart of Russian politics<r class="highlighted">. Russia renounced its claims to the ideological leadership</r> of an alternative system to the world capitalist order and the geopolitical leadership of an alternative military and political bloc, but it did not renounce <r class="highlighted">its civilizational identity or its aspirations to participate in global leadership.</r></u><r class="font6"> The external asymmetry allowed one side of the old Cold War conflict to claim the right to oversee the transformation of the other; and while this was at first welcomed in Russia, it increasingly came to be resented and exacerbated the tensions within the internal asymmetry. </r><u>While <r class="highlighted">the neo-conservative</r>s in Washington <r class="highlighted">stressed the imperial and global role t</r>hat the promotion of democratic values should play, <r class="highlighted">Moscow began to reassert an aggressive autonomy</r> in interna- tional affairs, insisting on the sovereign right of each country</u><r class="font6">, if not to claim a Sonderweg, then at least to choose its own path and to define democracy as it saw fit: the new ideology of ‘sovereign democracy’ that came to the fore after Ukraine’s ‘Orange’ revolution in late 2004.45 The fundamental failure in the post-Cold War era has been to find ways to compensate for the twofold asymmetry. Even the recognition of the problem—that Russia could not easily be categorized as just another ‘post-communist’ country— was a long time coming. The general difficulty of adjusting the  international system to the end of the bloc politics and hegemonic aspirations that were characteristic of the Cold War has still not been resolved. The key challenge after the dissolution of communist power in 1989–91, the winding-up of the Warsaw Pact in 1990 and the disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1991, was how to insert Russia into the new global order. This would have been relatively easy if Russia had been a defeated power (like Germany and Japan after 1945), but proved much harder to do on its own terms, as an endlessly proclaimed ‘great power’. As early as the December 1992 meeting of what was still the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) Kozyrev warned of the onset </r><u><r class="highlighted">of a ‘new Cold War’, and</r> such warnings have sounded regularly since then. The legitimacy of Russia’s ambition to be a great power, even a ‘normal’ one, has been questioned, even more than Britain’s and France’s aspirations in this respect. The major difference, of course, is that Russia’s readjusted role has been accompanied by a profound change in its internal political order, a process that is far from over. Grave issues of international politics have become interwoven into a constant regime <r class="highlighted">of inspection over how Russia is doing internally</r>.46 This asymmetry has been effectively exploited by the opposition in Russia. Domestic political actors soon learnt that easy political capital could be made by working the international circuit, condemning the latest alleged malfeasance by Russia’s rulers.47 Some of Russia’s neighbours learned the rules of this game only  </u><r class="font6">too well, and fed a constant stream of anti-Russian material to receptive ears on Capitol Hill and elsewhere.48 This then fed back into profoundly misinformed statements about developments in Russia and its policies, which in turn provoked Russian reactions that only deepened distrust and exacerbated suspicions about policy motivations.49 Thus all sides entered into a deeply negative spiral of mutual suspicion that gradually hardened into abuse which in turn gave way to threats and counterthreats. Russian domestic struggles were projected onto interstate rivalries. Indeed, the scholar Dmitry Furman argued that ‘There is only one opposition to Putin at present—other countries.’50 At the same time, America’s ideological wars for and against various abstractions—against terror and authoritarian capitalism, and for ‘global freedom’ and the like—affect specific countries, not least Russia.51 The net result is that the security of Europe and the world today is facing the gravest threat to peace since the end of the bloc politics of the Cold War. In some ways the threat is even greater, since the earlier confrontation had devised rules and stable expectations about how the conflict would be managed. Cold War conflict management procedures have been dismantled, while elements of the conflict have re-emerged in a far more anarchic context. Indeed, the political failure in the early 1990s, and once again in the early 2000s, to build on the evident desire of Russia to move beyond the Cold War, </r><u>and to create new organizations that could provide common institutional mechanisms to solidify what was by any reckoning an epochal shift in global politics, allowed old institutions and ways of thinking to reassert themselves.</u><r class="font6"> Integration within the framework of the EU was not accompanied by an inclusive pan-European unifi- cation process. In </r><u>Moscow the representatives of the old bloc mentality are now certainly in evidence once again, and their views are encouraged by their counter- parts in the West</u><r class="font6">. Sergei Karaganov, director of the Council for Foreign and Defence Policy (CFDP), argues that this is evidence that a ‘new epoch of confron- tation (NEC)’ is beginning. Even in the 1990s ‘</r><u>any attempt by Russia to stop the panicked retreat produced by the disintegration of the USSR was declared to be “<r class="highlighted">neo-imperialis</r>m”’, to the point that today ‘<r class="highlighted">the oversimplification of criticism on some parameters is even worse than in the Cold War</r> … Any critic or opponent of the Russian president and the Kremlin automatically becomes a democrat and friend of the West.’ Europe’s failure to act as an autonomous power and the inten- sified rivalry between ‘the traditional West and the energy-producing countries for control of energy resources’ mean that Russia ‘has been forced by history into the centre of a new competitive struggle between the liberal-democratic and authoritarian models of capitalism’.52 A report issued to mark the 15th anniversary of the CFDP on 16 March 2007 talked about <r class="highlighted">a global ‘crisis of manageability’, in</r> which no single power centre on its own could manage the crisis engendered by the growing number of failed and failing states.53 </u></p><br> <br> Card Number: 31<br> <br><h4>Framing of terrorism is based on irrational thoughts that create endless war and state control</h4><p>James <strong>Der Derian</strong>, leading IR theorist, respected professor, Political Science Professor, University of Massachusetts, 12/19/<strong>2008,</strong> Critical Practices in International Theory, pg. 70-72</p><p>For some, this kind of <u>intellectual activity</u> <u>might be considered subversive</u>.

Nation-states never enjoyed a true monopoly on the use of force, but now more than in any other post-Westphalian time- and certainly at the accelerated pace-the legitimacy of that monopoly has come under serious challenges from social, economic, technical, and military changes. Interdependent economies, global ecological concerns penetration by surveillance and media technologies, the three dimensionality and nuclearization- they have all been recognized as growing antidiplomatic forces undermining the sovereign <r class="highlighted">privileges and obligations of the territorial state. Less noticed and understood is the emergence of a terrorist discourse</r>,</u> by which I refer to <u>a global semiotic activity where violent powers and insurgent  meanings clash. WIth a nuclear statement curtailing superpower and a global information economy boosting sign-power, it is increasingly in <r class="highlighted">the discursive realm of terrorism that the "crises" of political legitimacy, national identity, and practical knowledge are being played out. Simultaneously brutalizing, repugnant, and fascinating, the terrorist repertoire-kidnapping, hijackings, and assassination- cannot alone account for its rise to the singular status of international crisis</r></u><r class="highlighted">. </r><u><r class="highlighted">In terrorist discourse</r></u> a less visible battle is being fought-most desperately between the vanguards of aspiring powers and the rearguards of great powers-to reinscribe the boundaries of legitimacy in international relations. In short, four important yet neglected theoretical points are being made here. <u><r class="highlighted">In the study of terrorism, method matters: but very little critical consciousness of just how much it matters has been demonstrated in the field</r>. Second, <r class="highlighted">method is matter given the symbolic practices of terrorism,</r> limitations of physical anti-terrorism, and <r class="highlighted">the simulacral projection of terrorism</r> by the media, the representations of terrorism have taken o n a powerful materiality. Third, because of changing configurations of power that rival traditional claims of international legitimacy, new critical methods are called for. Fourth, method alone cannot substitute for an ontological step that anyone seriously <r class="highlighted">seeking truths about terrorism must take: questioning how our own identity is implicated and constituted by the terrorist discourse must precede any study of terrorism.</r> These critical considerations inform the analysis of modern forms of terrorism that follows. Taking</u> into account the sheer volume of terrorist archive, I can make no claims for comprehensiveness. My strategy is <u><r class="highlighted">deconstructive and reconstructive:</r> to provide a method which might displace, <r class="highlighted">critique, and historicize received accounts of terrorism</r> and, simultaneously, to present an alternative primer <r class="highlighted">for reading terrorism in its multiple, de-terroitoralized</r> forms</u>. What I wish to avoid is the <u>subtextual ploy found in much of the terrorism literature where the theoretical organization of an inchoate body of thought pretends to reconcile the differences and contradictions of the terrorism, thus "taming" rather than interpreting a heavily conflicted field. At best, I hope to leave the reader with a critical method and the minimal amount of historical knowledge necessary <r class="highlighted">to distinguish the politically dispossessed from the violently possessed, and to imagine</r> possible forms of coexistence with the former, while galivanting collective action against the latter.  </u></p><br> <br> Card Number: 32<br> <br><h4>The case is a lie – terrorism truths are produced by fearmongering and faulty knowledge of the Other</h4><p><strong>Spencer</strong>, <strong>8</strong> – Lecturer in International Relations @ Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich (Alexander, and Rainer Hülsse, Assistant Professor of International Relations @ Ludwig-Maximilians-University, “The Metaphor of Terror: Terrorism Studies and the Constructivist Turn,” Security Dialogue vol. 39, no. 6, December)</p><p>In any case, most of what has been written on Al-Qaeda is based neither on interviews nor on field research conducted inside the organization. Rather, it builds on less-direct information – it is ‘veranda terrorism research’. Among the sources used are already existing studies of Al-Qaeda, media information and intelligence reports. <u>Obviously, <r class="highlighted">this leads to a rather incestuous field of knowledge</r>, where <r class="highlighted">one scholar reproduces</r></u> the unverified views of another and thus contributes to the circulation of the ever-same ‘facts’ (Reid, 1993). This is hardly a new insight about terrorism research, however. Back in 1988, one review found that ‘there are probably few areas in the social science literature in which so much is written on the basis of so little research’ (Schmid &amp; Jongman, 1988: 177). <u>Another remarked that ‘with a few clusters of exception there is, in fact, a disturbing <r class="highlighted">lack of good empirically-grounded research on terrorism’</r></u> (Gurr, 1988: 2). These findings have been subsequently confirmed – and deplored – on numerous occasions (e.g. Merari, 1991; Silke, 2001, 2004; Horgan, 2004; Schulze, 2004; Ranstorp, 2007). Obviously, this lack of primary research further aggravates the problem identified above, as it adds another layer of interpretation. Studies of this kind which predominantly use secondary information are interpretations of how others (e.g. intelligence staff or field-researching terrorism scholars) <u>have <r class="highlighted">interpreted Al- Qaeda</r> members’ <r class="highlighted">self-interpretation</r></u>. And yet, despite these various filters, information in such studies is presented as though it provided objective accounts of the reality about Al-Qaeda. This is particularly true for work that draws on intelligence reports and treats them as though they were primary sources (e.g. Burke, 2003; Gunaratna, 2002; Jacquard, 2001; Koch, 2005; Reeve, 1999). <u>Yet, even if an intelligence report is based on successful infiltration, <r class="highlighted">it provides not a description</r> but an interpretation <r class="highlighted">of Al-Qaeda.</r></u></p><br> <br> Card Number: 33<br> <br><h4>Warming rhetoric gets co-opted by the military furthering militarism - that turns the case </h4><p><strong>Marntinot, 07</strong> [Steve – Instructor at the Center for Interdisciplinary Programs at San Francisco State University, “Militarism and Global Warming”] <a href="http://www.greens.org/s-r/42/42-06.html">http://www.greens.org/s-r/42/42-06.html</a></p><p>In other words, <u><r class="highlighted">war is the factor that renders the military a self-generating cyclic producer of global warming</r></u><r class="font12">. </r><u><r class="highlighted">Wars add untold and inestimable damage to the ecology on all levels, while fulfilling their major function of producing mass murder. </r>War is the essential logic of <r class="highlighted">a military machine, and of an ethic and a politics of militarism</r></u><r class="font12"><r class="highlighted">.</r> </r><u>Its fundamental purpose is to guarantee access to resources</u><r class="font12">,</r> and in particular petroleum, for its constituency.

In addition, <r class="font12">t</r><u>he military has become a major industrial factor in the US itself, as part of a greater economic cycle.</u> This is a result of an ancillary economic process, the movement of runaway shops and of whole industries relocating to lower wage areas. Some industries moved south, others to Latin America, others to Asia or wherever on the globe they could be more exploitative. The US government, from the Reagan administration on, has provided subsidies to major industries to move to low-wage areas, and produced agreements in many countries for establishing export production zones — that is, zones in which production is only for export; they add little to the local host economies, and create international assembly lines whose only coherence is the multinational corporate structure that controls it. The effect of this process has been to gut the industrial base of the US <u>economy. The subsidiary internal effect was that <r class="highlighted">t</r>he military, the one industry that could not run away because it was strategic, gained economic hegemony by default. The US economy fell into the hands of the military-industrial complex. This brings us to <r class="highlighted">the third dimension of militarist self-generation as a global warming factor</r></u><r class="font12">.</r> In the face of runaway industries, the US economy has become dominated by military production. The military is now connected and conjoined to roughly 50% of all economic activity in the US. This doesn’t mean that 50% of all production is military production; it means that 50% of all economic activity is associated with the military, either in the production of military hardware, the running of bases, or in ancillary industries whose major customer is the military, and who thus owe their existence and functions to that major customer. <u>Military appropriations by Congress</u> may be 25% of the budget, but there are ripple and multiplier effects that expand the economic involvement of the military to far beyond that 25%. <u> … the citizens of that structure<r class="highlighted">, the corporations themselves, have no ethical concerns toward the planet nor toward life.</r> Here is how corporate control of the economy, a history of militarism, and corporate globalization all come together. <r class="highlighted">The US military is what facilitated the acquisition of exploitation righ</r>ts in other countries by US corporations, leaving the US economy essentially a military-oriented economy. That is, militarism has engendered a military economy. Second, it fosters a situation in which a transnational corporate structure becomes the predominant political force in the world; and the citizens of that structure, the corporations themselves, have no ethical concerns toward the planet nor toward life. Its ethics are governed by the maintenance of its stock value on the stock markets of the world. Thus, resource exploitation is its food, and resource consumption is its metabolism. <r class="highlighted">Militarism is the way corporations maintain their access to their food supply — the planet.</r> Because the military economy is by nature a monopoly, owing to government control, security clearances, national security considerations, etc., all military industries fall into a culture of corruption that is far beyond that of ordinary industries</u><r class="font12">. </r><u>This corruption is a cultural phenomenon that makes health and longevity an ancillary concern.</u><r class="font12"> In the interests of that corruption, beyond profit or stock price levels</r><u><r class="highlighted">, the military drives the political processes and thinking of this society to ideologically ignore or deny the problem of global warming</r>.</u> The profit picture is important, of course, and it leads the oil and coal interests to buy prostituted scientists to help them promulgate that denial.<u> But <r class="highlighted">the real opposition to recognition of global warming is more immediately the corruption that exudes from the military and its militarism.

Yet the question is raised whether <r class="highlighted">climate change apocalyptic</r> might be the one awful instance when apocalyptic proves to be right</u> - like the boy who repeatedly cried “Wolf!” <u>Apocalyptic</u> takes its name from an aberrant form of Judaism that developed around 200 B.C. It prevailed until the bar Cochba revolt in 135 C.E. That was when it <u>finally managed to <r class="highlighted">destroy itself</r> in an ill-conceived “end-time”</u> conflict with the Romans. After this, Rabbinic Judaism pronounced a curse on any Jew who persisted with apocalyptic<r class="highlighted">. </r><u><r class="highlighted">Scholars of apocalyptic literature and apocalyptic movements recognize that this development </r></u>within Judaism was the classical form of apocalyptic, providing a kind of  paradigm for other apocalyptic movements right down to our day, including especially  America’s religious Right,  Marxism and <u>Environmentalism</u>. Apocalyptic has been called “<u>a theology</u> [or a world view] of despair,” meaning that it is an outlook that has lost faith in the historical process. After Judaism had been ruled by one great power after another (Babylon, Persia, Greece and Syria), it lost faith that its aspirations for independent statehood under its own Davidic king would take place within the ordinary historical process. It therefore focused on a very bloody “end-time” solution that would terminate the ordinary historical process. The hallmark of apocalyptic is to see the world getting worse and worse – whether that is the ruling powers getting worse and worse (Jewish apocalyptic), humanity getting worse and worse (Christian apocalyptic), capitalist society getting worse and worse (Marxist apocalyptic), or the environment getting worse and worse (Greenpeace-style apocalyptic). In the case of the apocalyptic Zealots within Judaism, (if I may borrow some striking imagery from Albert Schweitzer) they threw themselves on the wheel of history in a last desperate effort to make it turn.  The wheel turned, but it crushed them rather than ending Greco-Roman civilization and the historical process. <u><r class="highlighted">With its 100% failure rate, apocalyptic movements illustrate one thing that apocalyptic environmentalism is yet to learn: it is people who are fragile, not the world with its historical process</r>. Its climate change alarmism is just another form of Salvationism - in this case the salvation of a supposedly fragile earth that is about to be destroyed by human activity</u>. When even school children are being conscripted to play a role in “saving the planet” by doing good little deeds like cutting back on water and energy consumption, planting trees and riding bikes instead of using cars, we may see how far this <u>apocalyptic salvationism has penetrated the popular culture.</u> Suppose we ask a good geologist such as Professor Ian Plimer to tell us, especially in the context of the current global warming panic, whether the earth is so fragile that it calls for human efforts to save it. Plimer has already given his published answer, and it is almost like a snort of derision. In <em>The Past is the Key to the Present</em>, Plimer says: “For at least the last 2500 Ma, the continents have been pulled apart and stitched back together. Every time the continents are pulled apart, huge quantities of volcanic H2O, CO2 and CH4 are released into the atmosphere and greenhouse conditions prevail. When continents stitch together, mountain ranges form. Mountains are stripped of soils, new soils form and remove CO2 from the atmosphere, these soils are stripped from the land and the CO2 becomes locked in sediments on the ocean floor. When atmospheric CO2 is low, glaciation occurs. Large climate cycles can be related to plate tectonics.”  (The full paper may be viewed at www.climatechangeissues.com/files/science/Plimer.doc ) Plimer goes on like this for page after page, portraying planet earth being pelted and pummeled with asteroids, intense global volcanism, mass extinctions, great ice ages, inter-glacial periods much warmer than our present “five minutes” of global warming, enormous sea-level changes, variations in atmospheric carbon dioxide from 6% to our present 0.037% and lower. In short, <u><r class="highlighted">a planet</r> <r class="highlighted">that has survived what planet earth has survived for 4.5 billion years is anything but fragile</r></u>. Plimer has also said that he wrote <em>A Short History of Planet Earth</em> because he “was inspired by a Greenpeace banner which read ‘Stop Climate Change.’ To stop climate change, one must stop supernova eruptions, solar flaring, sunspots, orbital wobbles, meteorites, comets, life, mountain building, erosion, weathering, sedimentation, continental drift, volcanoes, ocean currents, tides and ice armadas – no mean feat, even for Greenpeace!” www.smedg.org.au/plimer0701.html  Whether the earth, including its climate system, is fragile or resilient goes to the heart of the climate change debate. <u>The kind of world view that we bring to the debate determines how the facts about C02 and the climate are interpreted.</u> For instance, if in discussion with a climate alarmist you point out that CO2 represents only 3.6% of all greenhouse gases, and that humans produce only about 3% of all CO2 emissions, you may then make the point that the human contribution is only 0. l8% - not much more than 1 part in a 1000 of all greenhouse gases.  If anyone quibbles on the exact percentages here, you can double the human contribution and it is still comes out a very tiny number in the whole greenhouse equation.  <u>When the warming alarmists are confronted with these facts, they must resort to the argument that the climate is so finely tuned and earth’s systems are so fragile that this small human contribution – a human burp in a thunderstorm when compared with the vast natural greenhouse emitters - <r class="highlighted">will cause a catastrophic tipping point in the earth’s fragile climate system.</r></u><r class="highlighted"> </r><u><r class="highlighted">There is no danger</r> that this</u> super-tough, resilient old <u>planet will not be able to take</u> a bit of <u>extra CO2</u> in its stride as it has repeatedly done in its past history anyway. So much for the myth of the fragile earth!  <u><r class="highlighted">It is</r> also <r class="highlighted">a dangerous myth</r> because</u> like all apocalyptic myths<u> it has </u>the capacity to<u> hurt people.  <r class="highlighted">The policies</r> being <r class="highlighted">advocated</r> by the climate change alarmists call for drastic economic and <r class="highlighted">social changes, and they won’t be satisfied until they have destroyed civilization </r>as we know it. <r class="highlighted">If climate apocalyptic goes the way of all apocalyptic in being impatient and intolerant, no changes are going to be rapid enough or severe enough to inaugurate its post-industrial age</r>.  It will therefore throw itself on the wheel of history to force it to turn.

It "tends," as Hardt and Negri argue, "towards the absolute" (2004, 18) in that it polices civil society through elaborate security and surveillance systems, negates the rule of law, militarizes quotidian space, diminishes civil rights to the degree in which it increases torture, illegal incarceration, disappearances, and emergency regulations, and fosters a culture of fear, intolerance, and violent discrimination. Hardt and Negri, therefore, rightly argue that </r><u><r class="highlighted">war</r></u><r class="font6"> itself </r><u><r class="highlighted">has become "a permanent </r>social <r class="highlighted">relation</r></u><r class="font6">" and thereby the "primary organizing principle of society, and politics merely one of its means or guises" (ibid., 12). What Hardt and Negri suggest is new about today's global civil war is its biopolitical agenda. "War," they write, "has become a regime of biopower, that is, a form of rule aimed not only at controlling the population but producing and reproducing all aspects of social life" (ibid., 13). For example, the biopolitics of war entails the production of particular economic and cultural subjectivities, "creating new hearts and minds through the construction of new circuits of communication, new forms of social collaboration, and new modes of interaction" (ibid., 81). The ambiguity of Hardt and Negri's notion of biopower subtly resides in their adaptation of the language of social and political revolution, for it seems to be the regime of biopower, rather than the multitude, that absorbs and transvalues the revolutionary, that is, anti-colonial, spirit inscribed in the rhetoric of "new hearts and minds." At the same time, they argue, that a biopolitical definition of war "changes war's entire legal framework" (ibid., 21-22), for "whereas war previously was regulated through legal structures, war has become regulating by constructing and imposing its own legal framework" (ibid. 22). If none of this, at least in my mind, is marked by a particular originality of thought, then this may have to do with Hardt and Negri's reluctance to address the historical continuities between earlier wars of decolonization and contemporary global wars, the legacies of imperialism, and the imperative of race in orchestrating imperial, neo-colonial, and today's global civil wars. ¶ In fact, while biopolitical global warfare might be a new phenomenon on the sovereign territory of the United States of America, specifically after 11 September 2001, it is hardly news to "</r><u>people in the former colonies</u><r class="font6">, who," as Crystal Bartolovich points out, "</r><u>have long lived</u><r class="font6"> ???</r><u>at the</u><r class="font6"> </r><u>'crossroads' of</u><r class="font6"> global forces" (2000, 136), violence, and </r><u>wars</u><r class="font6">. For example, in Sri Lanka global civil war has been a permanent, everyday reality since the country's Sinhala Only Movement in 1956, and become manifest in the normalization of racialized violence as a means of politics since President Jayawardene's election campaign for a referendum in 1982, which led to the state-endorsed anti-Tamil pogrom in 1983. Similarly, according to Achille Mbembe, biopolitical warfare was intrinsic to the European imperial project in "Africa," where "war machines emerged" as early as "the last quarter of the twentieth century" (2003, 33). In other words, although Hardt and Negri argue convincingly that it is the ubiquity of global war that restructures social relationships on the global and local level, their concept tends to dehistoricize different genealogies and effects of global civil war. Indeed, not only do Hardt and Negri refrain from reading wars of decolonization as central to the construction of what David Harvey sees as the uneven "spatial exchange relations" (2003, 31) necessary for the expansion of capital accumulation and of which global war is an intrinsic feature, but they also dissociate global civil wars from the nation-state's still thriving ability to implement and exercise rigorous regimes of violence and surveillance. As for the term's epistemological formation, global civil war has been sanitized and no longer evokes the conventional association of civil war with "insurrection and resistance" (Agamben 2005, 2). Instead, it has become the effect of a diffuse new sovereignty (i.e., Hardt and Negri's Empire), a sovereignty that no longer decides over but has itself become a disembodied, that is, denationalized and normalized, state of exception. Yet, to talk about the disembodiment of global war not only reinforces media-supported ideologies of high-tech precision wars without casualties, but it also represses narratives about the ways in which the modi operandi of global war come to be embodied differently in different sites of war.¶ In her short story "Man Without a Mask" (1995), the Sri Lankan writer Jean Arasanayagam describes the global dimensions of a war that is usually considered an ethnic civil war restricted to internally competing claims to territorial, cultural, and national sovereignty between the country's Sinhalese and Tamil population. Told by an elite mercenary who clandestinely works for the ruling members of the government and leads a group of highly trained assassins, the story follows the thoughts of its narrator and contemplates the politicization of violence and death. As a mercenary and possibly an ex-SAS (British Special Air Service) veteran the Sri Lankan Government hired after the failure of the Indo-Lankan Accord, the narrator signifies the "privatization of [Sri Lanka's] war" (Tambiah 1996, 6) and, thus, the reign of a global free market economy through which the state hands over its institutions and services to private corporations, including its army, and profits from the unrestricted global and illegal trade in war technologies. Like a craftsman, the mercenary finds satisfaction in the precision and methodical cleanliness of his work, in being, as he says, "a hunter. Not a predator" in his ability to leave "morality" out of "this business" (Arasanayagam 1995, 98). He is an extreme and perverted version of what Martin Shaw describes as the " 'soldier-scholar,'???the archetype of the new [global] officer" (1999, 60). As a self-proclaimed "scholar or scribe" (ibid., 100), the mercenary plots maps of death. Shortly before he reaches his victim, a politician who underestimated the political ambition of his enemy, he comments that bullet holes in a human body comprise a new kind of language: "The machine gun splutters. The body is pitted, pricked out with an indecipherable message. They are the braille marks of the new fictions. People are still so slow to comprehend their meaning" (ibid., 100). These new maps or fictions of global war, I suggest, describe what Etienne Balibar calls ultra-objective and ultra-subjective violence and characterize how global civil war both generates bare life and manages and instrumentalizes death.¶ According to Balibar, </r><u>ultra-objective violence suggests the systematic "naturalization of asymmetrical relations of power</u><r class="font6">" (2001, 27) brought about, for instance, by the Sri Lankan government's prolonged abuse of the Prevention of Terrorism Act, which, in the past plunged the country into a permanent state of emergency, facilitated the random arrest of and almost absolute rule over citizens, and thus created a culture of fear and a reversal of moral and social values. As the story clarifies, under conditions of systematic or ultra-objective violence, "corruption" becomes "virtue" and "the most vile" man wears the mask of the sage and "innocent householder" (Arasanayagam 1995, 102). In this milieu, the mercenary has no need for a mask, because he bears a face of ordinary violence that is "perfectly safe" (ibid., 102) in a society structured by habitual and systemic violence. </r><u>But the logic of the "new fictions" of political violence is also ultra-subjective because it</u><r class="font6"> is "intentional" and </r><u>has a "determinate goal</u><r class="font6">" (Balibar 2001, 25), namely </r><u>the making and elimination of</u><r class="font6"> what Balibar calls "</r><u>disposable people</u><r class="font6">" in order </r><u>to generate and maintain a profitable global economy of violence. </u><r class="font6">The logic of ultra-subjective violence presents itself through the fictions of ethnicity and identity as they are advanced and instrumentalized in the name of national sovereignty. The mercenary perfectly symbolizes what Balibar means when he writes that "we have entered a world of the banality of objective cruelty" (ibid.). For if the fictions of global violence are scratched into the tortured bodies of war victims, the mercenary's detached behavior dramatizes a "will to 'de-corporation'," that is, to force disaffiliation from the other and from oneself ??? not just from belonging to the community and the political unity, but from the human condition" (ibid.). In other words, </r><u><r class="highlighted">while</r></u><r class="font6"> </r><u>global civil <r class="highlighted">war becomes embodied in those whom it </r></u><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">negates as social beings</r></r><r class="font6"> and thereby reduces to mere "flesh," </r><u><r class="highlighted">it remains </r>a <r class="highlighted">disembodied </r>enterprise <r class="highlighted">for those who</r></u><r class="font6"> manage and </r><u><r class="highlighted">orchestrate </r>the <r class="highlighted">politics </r>of death of global war. <r class="highlighted">It is through </r>the</u><r class="font6"> </r><u>dialectics of the embodiment and</u><r class="font6"> </r><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">disembodiment</r></r><u><r class="highlighted"> of </r>global violence <r class="highlighted">that the </r></u><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">dehumanization of the majority of the globe's population</r></r><u><r class="highlighted"> takes on a</r> normative and <r class="highlighted">naturalized state</r> of existence.<r class="font6">¶</r> </u><r class="font6">Arasanayagam's short story also casts light on the limitations of Hardt and Negri's understanding of the biopolitics of global civil war, for the latter can account neither for the new fictions of violence in former colonial spaces nor for what Mbembe calls the "necropolitics" (2003, 11) of late modernity. Mbembe's term refers to his analysis of global warfare as the continuation of earlier and the development of new "forms of subjugation of life to the power of death" and its attendant reconfiguration of the "the relationship between resistance, sacrifice, and terror" (2003, 39). 4 Despite the many theoretical intersections of Hardt and Negri's and Mbembe's work, Mbembe's notion of </r><u>necropolitics sees contemporary warfare as a species of </u><r class="font6">such </r><u>earlier</u><r class="font6"> "</r><u>topographies of cruelty</u><r class="font6">" (2003, 40) </r><u>as the</u><r class="font6"> plantation system and </r><u>the colony</u><r class="font6">. Thus, in contrast to Hardt and Negri, Mbembe argues that </r><u>the ways in which global violence and warfare produce subjectivities cannot be dissociated from the ways in which race serves as a means</u><r class="font6"> of both deciding over life and death and </r><u>of legitimizing and making killing without impunity a customary practice of imperial population control.</u><r class="font6"> If global civil war is a continuation of imperial forms of warfare, it must rely on strategies of embodiment, that is, of politicizing and racializing the colonized or now "disposable" body for purposes of self-legitimization, specifically when taking decisions over the value of human life. After all, on a global level, </r><u>race propels the ideological dynamics of ethnic and global civil war, while, on the local plane, it serves to orchestrate the brutalization and polarization of the domestic population, reinforcing and enacting patterns of racist exclusion and violence on the non-white body</u><r class="font6">. In contrast to Hardt and Negri, then, Mbembe invites us to articulate imperial genealogies for the necropolitics of today's global civil wars.¶ In other words, if imperialism was a form of perpetual low-intensity global war, the biopolitics of imperialism aimed at creating different forms of subjectivization. For example, while in India, the imperial administration sought to create a functional class of native informants, in Africa and the Caribbean, the British Empire created the figure of homo sacer. The latter, as Agamben argues, refers to the one who can be killed but not sacrificed. Homo sacer, Agamben clarifies, constitutes "the originary exception in which human life is included in the political order in being exposed to an unconditional capacity to be killed" (1998, 85). Thus, the native is included in the imperial order only through her exclusion, while, simultaneously her humanity is stripped of social life and transformed into bare life, ready to be commodified on slavery's auction blocs and foreclosed from the dominant imperial psyche. Agamben's understanding of bare life derives from his reading of the Nazi death camps as the paradigmatic space of modernity in which the distinction between "fact and law" (ibid., 171), "outside and inside, exception and rule, licit and illicit" (ibid., 170) dissolves and in which biopolitics takes the place of politics and "homo sacer" replaces the "citizen" (ibid., 171). While the notion of bare life is instrumental for theorizing biopolitics and the normalization and legalization of state violence under the pretense of, for example, protective arrests and preemptive strikes, it also suggests that the human body can be read as pure matter or in empirical terms. What goes unnoticed is to what extent the production of bare life depends on ideologies of race, that is, on the racialization of bodies, citizenship, and the concept of the human. For instance, under imperial rule, bare life is subjected to death and its politics in ways slightly different from those suggested by Agamben. More specifically, the killing of natives or slaves as bare life ??? then and today, as Rwanda's race-based genocide clarifies ??? not only configures human life in terms of its "capacity to be killed" (Agamben 1998, 114), that is as homicide and genocide outside of law and accountability, but also measures the value of human life on grounds of race. </r><r class="emphasis">The <r class="highlighted">making </r>of <r class="highlighted">bare life is a</r> racialized and <r class="highlighted">racializing process rooted within the necropolitics of colonialism</r>.</r><r class="font6"> For, killing the native or slave presupposes the remaking of the human into bare life both through ideologies of pseudo-scientific racism and by subjecting them to what Orlando Patterson calls the "social death" (1982, 38) of the slave, that is, to a symbolic death of the human as a communal and social being that precedes physical death. 5 Thus, imperialism's necropolitics involves the making of disposable lives through practices of zombification and the "redefinition of death" itself (Agamben 1998, 161). In this sense, imperialism not only facilitated the extreme forms of racialized violence characteristic of global civil war, but it also helped create the conditions for making bare life the acceptable state of being for the present majority of the globe's population.¶ Not unlike Jean Arasanayagam's short story, Mbembe's account of the Rwandan genocide and the Palestinian intifada suggests that the new global subjectivities are not so much the networked multitude Hardt and Negri imagine. Rather, emerging from the "new fictions" of global war, they are the suicide bomber, the mercenary, the martyr, the child soldier, the victim of mass rape, the refugee, the woman dispossessed of her family and livelihood, the mutilated civilian, and the skeleton of the disappeared and murdered victims of global civil war. What these subjectivities witness is that, on one hand, living under conditions of global civil war means to live in "permanent???pain" (Mbembe 2003, 39) and, on the other hand, they refer back to the dialectical mechanisms of colonial violence. For under the Manichaean pressures of colonialism, colonial violence always inaugurates a double process of subjection and subject formation. Frantz Fanon famously argues that anti-colonial violence operates historically on both collective and individual subject formation. For, on the one hand, "the native discovers reality [colonial alienation] and transforms it into the pattern of this customs, into the practice of violence and into his plan for freedom" (1963, 58), and on the other, a violent "war of liberation" instills in the individual a sense of "a collective history" (ibid., 93). Thus, as Robert Young suggests, anti-colonial violence "functions as a kind of psychotherapy of the oppressed" (2001, 295). Yet, it seems that read through the necropolitics of imperialism, global civil warfare no longer aims at the "pacification" of the colonial subject or the "degradation" of the "postcolonial subject" (ibid., 293) but, as I suggested earlier, at the complete abolishment of the human per se. We may therefore say that if global civil war produces new subjectivities, it does so through, what I have referred to as a process of zombification. Understood as sustained acts of negation, zombification ??? a term that harks back to Fanon ??? refers to a dialectical process of the embodiment and disembodiment of global war. The former refers to the exercise of ultra-objective violence ??? that is, the systematic "naturalization of asymmetrical relations of power" (Balibar 2001, 27) ??? in order to regulate, racialize, and extinguish human life at will, while the latter suggests the production of narratives of "de-corporation" (ibid., 25) and detachment by those who manage and administrate global civil war. The notion of zombification, however, connotes not only the exercise of, but also the exorcism of, the ways in which global war is scripted on and through the racialized body. Thus, a post-colonial understanding of global war needs to think through the necropolitics of war, including the uneven value historically and presently assigned to human life and the politicization of death. The latter issue will be addressed in the last section of this paper. The next section examines the cultural production and perpetuation of normative narratives of global warfare.¶ The Rhetoric of the Archaic and Michael Ondaatje's "Anil's Ghost"¶ Published shortly after Sri Lanka's civil war became entangled with the global politics of the South and the rise of the Sri Lankan nation-state to one of the war's principal and most corrupt actors, Ondaatje's novel Anil's Ghost dramatizes both the transformation of the country's civil war into a permanent state of exception and the failure of global non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to intervene in the war's rising human rights abuses and violent excesses. While the novel presents an extraordinary search for social justice through narrative and seeks to understand the operative modes of violence beyond their historical and social configurations, it also tends to sublimate and aestheticize violence by treating it as a normative element of human and, indeed, planetary life. My purpose here is to indicate that the novel's own project of dramatizing the complicity between religious and secular, anti-colonial and nationalist agents of war, and civilians and global actors (i.e., NGOs) remains compromised by the novel's aesthetic investment in a particular rhetoric of the archaic. The latter, I argue, unwittingly coincides with normative narratives of global war and facilitates the reader's detachment from the ways in which the Global North has reconstructed global life as a permanent state of exception.¶ Ondaatje's novel (2000) opens with an Author's Note that locates the narrative at a time when "the antigovernment insurgents in the south and the separatist guerrillas in the north???had declared war on the government" and "legal and illegal government squads were???sent out to hunt down" both groups. In this instance, the Hobbesian rhetoric of a "war of all against all" is more than a clich??. In fact, it is symptomatic of the novel's ambiguous critique of the role of the Sri Lankan nation-state and its elaborate, modernist discourse of violence. The Note foreshadows what the narrator later repeats on several occasions, namely that Sri Lanka's war is a war fought "for the purpose of war" (ibid., 98) and for which "[t]here is no hope of affixing blame" (ibid., 17). In short, the "reason for war was war" (ibid., 43). At first glance, the narrative's emphasis on the war's self-perpetuating dynamics implies a Hobbesian understanding of violence as the natural state of human existence. At the same time, it translates the actual politics of Sri Lanka's war into the Deleuzean idiom of the "war machine." For, according to Deleuze and Guattari, armed conflict functions outside the control and accountability of the "state apparatus???prior to its laws" (1987, 352), and beyond its initial causes. Although such an interpretation of Sri Lanka's war reflects what the political scientist Jayadeva Uyangoda calls the "intractability of the Sri Lankan crisis" (1999, 158), its political and ethical stakes outweigh its gains. 6¶ To begin with, the novel's leitmotif of "perpetual war" situates Sri Lanka's conflict within a general context of global war, because, as the narrator reports, it is fought with "modern weaponry," supported by "backers on the sidelines in safe countries," and "sponsored by gun-and drug-runners" (Ondaajte 2000, 43). In this scenario, the rule of law has deteriorated into "a belief in???revenge" (ibid., 56), and the state is either absent or part of the country's all-consuming anarchy of violence. This absence suggests that the state no longer functions, in Max Weber's famous words, as "a human community that (successfully) claims the monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force within a given territory" (2002, 13). It is of course possible to argue that the novel's critique of the Sri Lankan nation-state lies in its absence. It seems to me, however, that </r><u><r class="highlighted">the</r> narrative's <r class="highlighted">tendency to locate</r> </u><r class="font6">the dynamics of Sri Lanka's</r><u> <r class="highlighted">war outside the state</r> and within a post-national vision of a new global order </u><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">generates a normative narrative of global war</r></r><r class="font6">. </r><u><r class="highlighted">On the one hand, it resonates with the</r> </u><r class="font6">popular ??? though </r><u><r class="highlighted">misleading</r></u><r class="font6"> ??? </r><u><r class="highlighted">notion</r></u><r class="font6"> that the "appearance </r><u><r class="highlighted">of</r> 'failed states'</u><r class="font6">," as Samuel Huntington argues in his controversial study The Clash of Civilizations, intensifies "tribal, ethnic, and religious conflict" </r><u>and thus "contributes to [the] image of <r class="highlighted">a world in anarchy</r></u><r class="font6">" (1996, 35). </r><u><r class="highlighted">On the other, situating</r> Sri Lanka's <r class="highlighted">war outside </r>the <r class="highlighted">institutions</r> of the state <r class="highlighted">re-inscribes a</r> Hobbesian <r class="highlighted">notion of violence that helps</r> </u><r class="emphasis">legitimize and <r class="highlighted">cultivate structural violence</r></r><u><r class="highlighted"> as </r>a <r class="highlighted">permissive </r>way of conducting politics</u><r class="font6">. Such a reading of violence, however, overlooks that in a global context violence has become "profoundly anti-Hobbesian" (Balibar 2001, xi). Balibar usefully suggests that </r><u>the twentieth century history of extreme violence has made it impossible to regard violence as "a structural condition that precedes institutions."</u><r class="font6"> Instead, he maintains, "we have had to accept???that extreme </r><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">violence</r></r><r class="font6"> </r><u>is not post-historical but actually post-institutional." It "</u><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">arises from institutions</r></r><r class="font6"> as much as it arises against them" (ibid., xi). Thus, in such popular post-colonial narratives of war as Anil's Ghost, </r><u>the normalization of violence figures as a forgetting of the institutional entrenchment and historical use of violence as a state-sanctioned political practice</u><r class="font6">.¶ If Ondaatje's novel presents Sri Lanka's war as an "inherently violent" event (Das 1998), it is also an event narrated through the symbolism and logic of archaic primitivism. For example, in the novel's central passage on the nature of human violence, the narrator observes, "The most precisely recorded moments of history lay adjacent to the extreme actions of nature or civilisation ???Tectonic slips and brutal human violence provided random time-capsules of unhistorical lives???A dog in Pompeii. A gardener in Hiroshima" (Ondaatje 2002, 55). </r><u>The symbolic leveling of</u><r class="font6"> the arbitrariness of primordial chaos and </r><u>the apparently </u><r class="emphasis">ahistorical anarchism of violence</r><u> create a rhetoric</u><r class="font6"> of the archaic that is characteristic, as Nancy argues, of "anything that is properly to be called war" (2000, 128). He convincingly argues that archaic symbolism "indicates </r><u>that [war] escapes from being part of 'history' understood as</u><r class="font6"> the progress of a linear/or </r><r class="emphasis">cumulative time"</r><r class="font6"> </r><r class="emphasis">and can be rearticulated as no more than a "regrettable" remnant of an earlier age</r><r class="font6"> (ibid., 128). In that, Nancy's observation coincides with Hardt and Negri's that </r><u><r class="highlighted">the "war on terror" </r>employs a medievalist <r class="highlighted">rhetoric of just and unjust wars </r>that </u><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">moralizes</r></r><u><r class="highlighted"> </r>rather than legitimizes the use of <r class="highlighted">global violence</r> by putting it outside the realm of reason and critique</u><r class="font6">. In Nancy's observation, however, two things are at stake. First, what initially appears to be a postmodern critique of the grand narratives of history in fact demonstrates that a non-linear account of history may lend itself to the transformation of extreme violence into exceptional events. In this way </r><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">violence is normalized as a </r>transhistorical <r class="highlighted">category that fails to address the unequal </r>political and economic <r class="highlighted">relations of power, which lie at the heart of global wars</r></r><r class="font6"><r class="highlighted">.</r>¶ Second, Nancy rightly warns us against treating war as an archaic relic that is "tendentiously effaced in the progress and project of a global humanity" (2000, 128). For not only does war return in the process of negotiating sovereignty on a global and local plane, but the representation of war in terms of archaic images also repeats a primordialist explanation of what are structurally new wars. As theorists such as Appadurai and Kaldor have argued, the primordialist hypothesis of global wars merely reinforces those mass mediated images of global violence that dramatize ethnic wars as pre-modern, tribalist forms of strife. Huntington's notion of civilization or "fault-line" wars as communal conflicts born out of the break-up of earlier political formations, demographic changes, and the collision of mutually exclusive religions and civilizations presents the most prominent and politically influential version of a primordialist and bipolar conceptualization of global war. In contrast to Huntington's approach, however, the narrative of Anil's Ghost contends that all forms of violence "have come into their comparison" (Ondaatje 2000, 203). Notwithstanding its universalizing impetus, </r><u>the novel</u><r class="font6"> thus </r><u>insists on the impossibility to think the nation and a new global order outside the technologies of violence and modernity</u><r class="font6">. Indeed, in the novel's narrative </r><u>it is the suffering of all war victims that "has come into their comparison" and </u><r class="font6">suggests that the </r><r class="emphasis">new wars breed a culture of violence that shapes everyone's life yet for which no one appears to be accountable. </r><r class="font6">On the one hand, then, the novel's self-critical humanitarian project seeks to initiate a communal and individual process of mourning by naming, and therefore accounting for, in Anil's words, "the unhistorical dead" (ibid, 56). On the other hand, read as its critical investment in the war's politics of complicity, the novel's humanitarian endeavor is countered by the narrator's tendency to articulate violence in archaic and anarchistic terms. For, to revert to the symbolic language of "primitivism and anarchy" and "to treat [the new wars] as natural disasters," as Kaldor observes (2001, 113), designates a common way of dealing with them. Thus </r><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">the rhetoric</r> of the archaic not merely dehistoricizes violence but <r class="highlighted">contributes to the</r></r><r class="font6"> making of a </r><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">normative</r></r><r class="font6"> and popular </r><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">imaginary through which to make global wars thinkable</r></r><r class="font6"> and comprehensible. Thus, </r><u>their <r class="highlighted">violent excesses appear</r> to be <r class="highlighted">rooted in primordialist </r>constructions</u><r class="font6"> </r><u>of the failed</u><r class="font6"> post-colonial nation-</r><u><r class="highlighted">state</r></u><r class="font6"><r class="highlighted"> </r></r><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">rather than</r> a phenomenon with <r class="highlighted">deep</r>-seated <r class="highlighted">roots in the global histories </r>of the present</r><r class="font6"><r class="highlighted">. </r></r><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">Such a normative imaginary of global war is produced for the</r> Global <r class="highlighted">North</r> so as <r class="highlighted">to dehistoricize its</r> own <r class="highlighted">position </r>in the various colonial processes of nation formation and global economic restructuring of the Global South.</r><r class="font6"> In this way, as Ondaatje's novel equally demonstrates, </r><u>the</u><r class="font6"> Global </r><u>North can detach itself</u><r class="font6"> from the Global South </r><u>and create the</u><r class="font6"> kind of </r><r class="emphasis">historical</r><r class="font6"> and cultural </r><r class="emphasis">distance</r><r class="font6"> </r><r class="emphasis">needed to accept ultra-objective violence as a normative state of existence.<r class="font6">¶</r> </r><r class="font6">Conceptualizing war as a phenomenon of criminal and anarchistic violence, however, may do more than merely conform to the popular imagination about the chaotic and untamable nature of contemporary warfare. Indeed, anarchistic notions of violence tend to compress the grand narratives and petite recits of history into a total, singular present of perpetual uncertainty, fear, and political confusion and generate what the post-colonial anthropologist David Scott sees as Sri Lanka's "dehistoricized" history. Given the important role the claiming of ancient Sinhalese and Hindu history played in the violent identity politics that drive Sri Lanka's war, Scott suggests that devaluing or dehistoricizing history as a founding category of Sri Lanka's narrative of the nation breaks the presumably "natural???link between past identities and the legitimacy of present political claims" (1999, 103). This strategy seems useful because it uncouples Sri Lanka's colonially shaped and glorified Sinhalese past from its present claims to political power. We need to note, however, that, according to Scott, dehistoricizing the past does not suggest writing from a historical vacuum. Rather, it refers to a process of denaturalizing and, thus, de-legitimizing the normative narratives of ethnicized and racialized narratives of national identity.¶ Anil's Ghost engages in this process of "</r><u>dehistoricizing</u><r class="font6">" by foregrounding the fictitious and fragmented, the elusive and ephemeral character of </r><u>history</u><r class="font6">. Indeed, as the historian Antoinette Burton suggests, the novel </r><u>offers "a reflection on </u><r class="emphasis">the continued possibility of History itself as an exclusively western epistemological form</r><r class="font6">" (2003, 40). The latter clearly finds expression in what Sarath's brother, Gamini, condemns as "the last two hundred years of Western political writing" (Ondaatje 2000, 285). Steeped in the imperial project of the West, such writing is facilitated by and serves to erase the figure of the non-European cultural Other in order to produce and maintain what Jacques Derrida famously called the "</r><u>white mythology</u><r class="font6">" (1982, 207) of Western metaphysics. The novel usefully </r><u>extends</u><r class="font6"> its reading of </r><u>violence into</u><r class="font6"> a related critique of </r><u><r class="highlighted">knowledge production</r></u><r class="font6"><r class="highlighted">,</r> </r><r class="emphasis">so that the latter <r class="highlighted">becomes</r> </r><r class="font6">legible as</r><r class="emphasis"> </r><r class="font6">being</r><r class="emphasis"> <r class="highlighted">complicit in </r>the production of <r class="highlighted">perpetual violence</r> and war</r><r class="font6">. This critique is perhaps most articulated through the character of Palipana, Sarath's teacher and Sri Lanka's formerly renowned but now fallen anthropologist. Once an agent of Sri Lanka's anti-colonial liberation movement, Palipana represents the generation of cultural nationalist who sought history and national identity in an essentially Sinhalese culture and natural environment. Rather than employing empirical and colonial methods of knowledge production and historiography, Palipana had left the path of scientific objectivity, tinkered with translations of historical texts, and "approached runes???with the pragmatic awareness of locally inherited skills" (Ondaatje 2000, 82) until "the unprovable truth emerged" (ibid., 83). Now, years after his fall from scientific grace, Palipana lives the life of an ascetic, following the "strict principles of" a "sixth-century sect of monks" (ibid., 84). To him, history and nature have become one, for "all history was filled with sunlight, every hollow was filled with rain" (ibid., 84). Yet, Ondaatje's construction of Palipana and his account of the eye-painting ritual of a Buddha statue ??? a ritual that assumes a central place in the novel's cosmopolitan vision of artisanship as a practice of cultural and religious syncretism in the service of post-conflict community building ??? are themselves built on a number of historical texts listed in the novel's "Acknowledgment" section. As Antoinette Burton astutely observes, "the orientalism of some of the texts on Ondaatje's list is astonishing, a phenomenon which suggests the ongoing suppleness of 'history' as an instrument of political critique and ideological intervention" (2003, 50). Rather than effectively "dehistorizing" the character of Palipana, then, Ondaatje bases this character and the eye-painting ceremony on a central Sri Lankan modernist text, Ananada K. Coomaraswamy's Mediaeval Sinhalese Art (1908/1956).¶ Cont ¶ For Hardt and Negri, then, the state of exception functions as the universal condition and legitimization of global civil war, while positioning the United States as a global power, which transforms war "into the primary organizing principle of society" (2004, 12). They rightly observe that </r><r class="emphasis">the state of exception blurs the boundaries between peace and war, violence and mediation</r><r class="font6">. Yet, curiously enough, Hardt and Negri's understanding of the state of exception largely emphasizes the concept's regulatory and pragmatic politics, so that the United States emerges as a sovereign power on grounds of its ability to decide on the state of exception. By exempting itself from international law and courts of law, protecting its military from being subjected to international control, allowing preemptive strikes, and engaging in torture and illegal detention (ibid., 8), the United States instrumentalizes and maintains war as a state of exception in the name of global security and thus seeks to consolidate its hegemonic role within Empire. Although Hardt and Negri openly disagree with Agamben's reading of the state of exception as defining "power itself as a 'monopoly of violence' " (2004, 364), it seems to me that Agamben's theory of the state of exception, as put forward in Homo Sacer rather than in States of Exception, might be usefully read alongside Hardt and Negri's crucial claim that global civil war as well as resistance movements depend on the "production of subjectivity" through immaterial labour (2000, 66). What this argument overlooks is that, according to Agamben, the state of exception constitutes an abject space or "a zone of indistinction between outside and inside, exclusion and inclusion" (1998, 181), where subjectivity enters a political and legal order solely on grounds of its exclusion. Moreover, the sovereign ??? albeit a nation, sovereign power, or global network of power ??? can only transform the rule of law into the force of law by suspending the legal system from a position that is simultaneously inside and outside the law. Through these mechanisms of exclusion and contradiction, subjectivity is not so much created as it is deprived of its social and political relationships. Thus </r><u>the "originary activity" of global civil war is the violent conflation of political and social relationship and thereby the "production of bare life"</u><r class="font6"> (ibid., 83), </r><u>of life that need not be accounted for</u><r class="font6">, </r><u>as is the case with the civilian casualties</u><r class="font6"> of the US-led war against Iraq. The state of exception, however, also figures as a prominent concept in post-colonial theory, for it raises questions not only about the ways in which we configure the human but also how we understand imperial or global war. ¶ In 1940, Benjamin famously wrote, "</r><u>the tradition of the oppressed teaches us that the 'state of emergency' </u><r class="font6">in which we live </r><u>is not the exception but the rule. </u><r class="emphasis">We must attain to a conception of history that is in keeping with this insight</r><r class="font6">" (1968, 257). Benjamin's statement, as Homi Bhabha reminds us half a century later in his essay "Interrogating Identity," can be usefully advanced for a critical analysis of the dialectical ??? if not revolutionary ??? relationship between oppression, violence, and anti-colonial historiography. Indeed, "the state of emergency," as Bhabha says, "is also always a state of emergence" (1994, 41). Read in the context of today's global state of exception, namely the recurrence and intensification of ethnic civil wars across the globe and the coincidence of democratic and totalitarian forms of political rule, Bhabha's statement entails a number of risks and suggestions for a post-colonial historiography of global civil war.¶ First, Bhabha's notion of emergency/emergence reflects his critical reading of Fanon's vision of national identity and thus reconsiders the state of emergency as a possible site of "the occult instability where the people dwell" (Fanon 1963, 227) and give birth to popular movements of national liberation. In this context, the state of exception might be understood as both constitutive to the alienation that is intrinsic to liberation movements and instrumental for a radical euphoria and excessive hope that create and spectralize the post-colonial nation-state as a deferred promise of decolonization. It is through this perspective that we can critically evaluate Hardt and Negri's endorsement of what they call "democratic violence" (2004, 344). This kind of violence, they argue, belongs to the multitude. It is neither creative nor revolutionary but used on political rather than moral grounds. When organized horizontally, according to democratic principles of decision making, democratic violence serves as a means of defending "the accomplishments" of "political and social transformation" (ibid., 344). Notwithstanding the concept's romantic and utopian inflections, democratic violence also derives from Hardt and Negri's earlier argument that "the great wars of liberation are (or should be) oriented ultimately toward a 'war against war,' that is, an active effort to destroy the regime of violence that perpetuates our state of war and supports the systems of inequality and oppression." This, they conclude, is "a condition necessary for realizing the democracy of the multitude" (ibid., 67). In one quick stroke, Hardt and Negri move anti-colonial liberation wars into their post-national paradigm of Empire and divest them of their cultural and historical particularities. Moreover, translating explicitly national liberation movements into a universalizing narrative of global pacifism precludes a critique of violence within its particular historical and philosophical formation. In contrast</r><u>, a post-colonial analysis of global war must tease out the intersections between the ways in which </u><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">racialized violence constitutes</r></r><u> </u><r class="font6">colonial and post-colonial processes of</r><u> </u><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">nation</r> <r class="highlighted">formation and </r>helps <r class="highlighted">construct an </r>absolute <r class="highlighted">enemy through which to legitimize </r>global <r class="highlighted">war and </r>to <r class="highlighted">abdicate responsibility for </r>the <r class="highlighted">dehumanizing </r>effects of <r class="highlighted">global</r> <r class="highlighted">economic restructuring</r>.</r><r class="font6">¶ Second, while Bhabha's pun is symptomatic of the resisting properties that he sees as operative in the various practices of colonial ambiguity, it also, despite Benjamin's opinion, draws attention to the possibility that </r><u>oppression alters the linear flow of Western history and challenges "the transparency of social reality, as a pre-given image of human knowledge</u><r class="font6">" (Bhabha 1994, 41). Here, Bhabha rightfully asks to what extent do states of emergency or acts of extreme violence constitute a historical rupture and, more importantly, call into question the nature of the human subject. It is at this point that a post-colonial reading of the state of exception fruitfully coincides with Agamben's notion of exception. For in both cases, the focus of inquiry is the construction of disposable life through the logic of necropower and the collapse of social and political relationships that enable the exercise of particularly racialized forms of violence, including torture and disappearances.¶ Third, Bhabha's notion of the double movement of emergency and emergence envisions an anti-colonialist historiography in terms of a dialectical process of perpetual transformation. It is at this point, however, that the coupling of emergency or exception and emergence becomes problematic for at least two reasons. First, combining both terms prematurely translates the violence of the political event into that of metaphor and risks erasing the </r><u>micro- or quotidian narratives of violence</u><r class="font6"> ??? such as Arasanayagam's account of war ??? that both </r><u>legitimate</u><r class="font6"> and are perpetuated by political and social </r><u>states of emergency</u><r class="font6">. In order to examine the relationship between global and communal forms of violence, a critical practice of post-colonial studies, I suggest, must reassess the term "transformation" and, concurrently, the assumption that acts of extreme global violence can be advanced in the service of "making history" (Balibar 2001, 26). In other words, if, as Hannah Arendt argues, there has been a historical "reluctance to deal with violence as a separate phenomenon in its own right" (2002, 25), it is time to examine the possibility of employing post-colonial studies in the service of a non-dialectical critique of global war. This kind of </r><u>critique must ask to what extent those on whose bodies extreme violence was exercised are </u><r class="emphasis">a priori excluded from articulating any transformative theory of violence</r><r class="font6">. </r><u>How</u><r class="font6">, in other words, </r><u>does bare life</u><r class="font6"> ??? if at all possible ??? </r><u>attain the status of subjectivity within the dehumanizing logic of exception or global civil war?<r class="font6">¶</r> </u><r class="font6">Fourth, like Bhabha, </r><u><r class="highlighted">we need to take seriously</r></u><r class="font6"> Benjamin's insight into </r><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">the intrinsic relationship between violence and the conceptualization of history</r>.</r><r class="font6"> Notwithstanding Bhabha's pivotal argument that the violence of </r><u>a "unitary notion of history</u><r class="font6">" generates a "unitary," and therefore extremely violent, "concept of man" (1994, 42), I wish to caution, alongside Benjamin's analysis of fascism, that what enables today's global civil war is that even "its opponents treat it as a historical norm" (Benjamin 1968, 257). What is at stake, then, in dominant as well as critical narratives of global civil war is their representation as natural rather than political phenomena, and the acceptance of globalization as a political fait accompli. Both of these aspects, I believe, </r><r class="emphasis">contribute to the proliferation of dehistoricized concepts of the global increase of racialized violence and war</r><r class="font6">. It seems to me, however, that </r><r class="emphasis">the <r class="highlighted">enormous </r>rise of<r class="highlighted"> violence</r></r><r class="font6"> </r><u>inflicted by global civil wars</u><r class="font6"> </r><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">requires</r></r><r class="font6"> a post-colonial historiography and </r><r class="emphasis">critique</r><r class="font6"> of global war </r><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">that questions</r> notions of history based on </r><r class="font6">cultural</r><r class="emphasis"> fragmentation</r><r class="font6">, rupture, and totalization. </r><r class="emphasis">Instead</r><r class="font6">, such a </r><r class="emphasis">historiography must <r class="highlighted">seek out patterns of </r>connection and <r class="highlighted">connectivity</r></r><r class="font6">. But more importantly, as I have argued in this paper, </r><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">it must</r></r><r class="font6"> trace the post-colonial moment of global civil war and begin to </r><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">read contemporary war through the interconnected necropolitics of global and imperial warfare</r>.</r><r class="font6"> Thus, to understand the logic and practice of global war we need to develop a greater understanding precisely of those civil wars and national liberation wars that do not appear to threaten the new global order. Furthermore, a post-colonial critique of global civil war should facilitate the decoding and rescripting of both the normalizing narratives and racialized embodiment of global civil warfare.¶ </r></p><br> <br> Card Number: 37<br> <br><h4>Security threats are <u>political constructions</u> by experts to justify <u>constant militarism</u></h4><p>Aziz <strong>Rana 12</strong>, Assistant Professor of Law, Cornell University Law School; A.B., Harvard College; J.D., Yale Law School; PhD., Harvard University, July 2012, “NATIONAL SECURITY: LEAD ARTICLE: Who Decides on Security?,” 44 Conn.

In particular, </r><u>a closer examination of contemporary arguments about endemic danger suggests</u><r class="font7"> that </r><r class="emphasis">such <r class="highlighted">claims are not objective </r>empirical judgments</r><u>, but <r class="highlighted">rather</r></u><r class="font7"> are </r><u><r class="highlighted">socially complex and politically infused </r>interpretations</u><r class="font7">. Indeed, the openness of existing circumstances to multiple interpretations of threat implies that the presumptive need for secrecy and centralization is not self-evident.

All </r><u>this indicates that the gulf between elite knowledge and lay incomprehension in matters of security may be far less extensive than is ordinarily thought. It also means that the question of who decides</u><r class="font7">-and with it the issue of how democratic or insular our institutions should be-</r><u>remains open</u><r class="font7"> as well.</r><r class="font6">¶</r><r class="font7"> Clearly, </r><u>technological changes, from airpower to biological and chemical weapons, have shifted the nature of America's position in the</u><r class="font7"> [*1487] </r><u>world and its potential vulnerability</u><r class="font7">. As has been widely remarked for nearly a century, the oceans alone cannot guarantee our permanent safety. Yet in truth, they never fully ensured domestic tranquility. The nineteenth century was one of near continuous violence, especially with indigenous communities fighting to protect their territory from expansionist settlers. n312 </r><u>But even if technological shifts make doomsday scenarios more chilling than those faced by Hamilton, Jefferson, or Taney, </u><r class="emphasis">the mere existence of these scenarios tells us little about their likelihood or how best to address them</r><r class="font7">. Indeed, </r><u>these latter security judgments are inevitably permeated with </u><r class="emphasis">subjective political assessments</r><u>-assessments that carry with them preexisting ideological points of view-such as</u><r class="font7"> regarding how much risk constitutional societies should accept or </r><u>how interventionist states should be in foreign policy</u><r class="font7">.</r><r class="font6">¶</r><r class="font7"> In fact, from its emergence in the 1930s and 1940s, supporters of the modern security concept have-at times unwittingly-reaffirmed the political rather than purely objective nature of interpreting external threats. In particular, commentators have repeatedly noted the link between the idea of insecurity and America's post- World War II position of global primacy, one which today has only expanded following the Cold War. n313 In 1961, none other than Senator James William Fulbright declared, in terms reminiscent of Herring and Frankfurter, that security imperatives meant that "our basic constitutional machinery, admirably suited to the needs of a remote agrarian republic in the 18th century," was no longer "adequate" for the "20th-century nation." n314 For Fulbright, the driving impetus behind the need to jettison antiquated constitutional practices was the importance of sustaining the country's "pre-eminen[ce] in political and military power." n315 Fulbright believed that greater executive action and war- making capacities were essential precisely because the United States found itself "burdened with all the enormous responsibilities that accompany such power." n316 According to Fulbright, the United States had [*1488] both a right and a duty to suppress those forms of chaos and disorder that existed at the edges of American authority. n317 Thus, rather than being purely objective, </r><u><r class="highlighted">the</r> American <r class="highlighted">condition of permanent danger was</r> itself <r class="highlighted">deeply tied to political calculations about </r>the importance of global <r class="highlighted">primacy</r>. What generated the condition of continual crisis was not only technological change, but also the belief that the United States' own national security rested on the successful projection of power</u><r class="font7"> into the internal affairs of foreign states.</r><r class="font6">¶</r><r class="font7"> The key point is that </r><r class="emphasis">regardless of whether one agrees with such an underlying project</r><u>, the value of this project is ultimately an open political question</u><r class="font7">. </r><u>This suggests that</u><r class="font7"> </r><u><r class="highlighted">whether distant crises should be viewed as generating insecurity</r> at home <r class="highlighted">is</r> similarly <r class="highlighted">as much </r>an </u><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">interpretative </r>judgment <r class="highlighted">as </r>an empirically <r class="highlighted">verifiable</r></r><u><r class="highlighted"> </r>conclusion</u><r class="font7">. n318 To appreciate the open nature of security determinations, one need only look at the presentation of terrorism as a principle and overriding danger facing the country. According to National Counterterrorism Center's 2009 Report on Terrorism, in 2009 there were just twenty-five U.S. noncombatant fatalities from terrorism worldwide-nine abroad and sixteen at home. n319 </r><u>While the fear of a terrorist attack is a legitimate concern, these numbers-which have been consistent in recent years-place the gravity of the threat in perspective. Rather than a condition of endemic danger</u><r class="font7">-requiring ever-increasing secrecy and centralization-</r><u>such <r class="highlighted">facts are</r> perfectly <r class="highlighted">consistent with a reading that Americans </r></u><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">do not</r> face an existential <r class="highlighted">crisis</r></r><r class="font7"> (one presumably comparable to Pearl Harbor) and </r><u>actually enjoy relative security.</u><r class="font7"> Indeed, the </r><u>disconnect between numbers and resources expended</u><r class="font7">, especially in a time of profound economic insecurity, </r><u>highlights the political choice of policymakers and citizens to persist in interpreting foreign events through a</u><r class="font7"> World War II and early Cold War </r><r class="emphasis">lens of permanent threat.</r><r class="font7"> In fact, the continuous alteration of basic constitutional values to fit national security aims emphasizes just how entrenched Herring's old vision of security as pre-political and foundational has become, regardless of whether other interpretations of the present moment may be equally compelling.</r><r class="font6">¶</r><r class="font7"> It also underscores a telling and often ignored point about the nature of [*1489] modern security expertise, particularly as reproduced by the United States' massive intelligence infrastructure. </r><u>To the extent that political assumptions-like the centrality of global primacy or the view that instability abroad necessarily implicates security at home-shape the interpretative approach of executive officials, <r class="highlighted">what passes as </r>objective security <r class="highlighted">expertise is </r>itself </u><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">intertwined with </r>contested claims about <r class="highlighted">how to view external actors</r></r><u><r class="highlighted"> </r>and their motivations.

Politicians are a part of the system; they don’t want to change it. For them, all the insecurity, death and ill-health caused by capitalist inequality are a price worth paying to keep the basic social structures as they are. A more egalitarian society based on equality, solidarity, and other non-materialist values would not suit their interests, or the special interests of the lobby groups they are indebted to.

Discussing the relationship of the “philosophy of praxis” to political practice, Gramsci claims: It [the </r><u>theory</u><r class="font5">] does not tend to leave the “simple” in their primitive philosophy of common sense, but rather to lead them to a higher conception of life. If it </r><u>affirms the need for contact between intellectuals and “simple”</u><r class="font5"> it is not in order to restrict scientific activity and preserve unity at the low level of the masses, but precisely </r><u>in order to construct an intellectual–</u><r class="font5">moral </r><u>bloc which can make politically possible the intellectual progress of the mass</u><r class="font5"> and not only of small intellectual groups. (Gramsci 1971: 332–333) According to Gramsci, this attempt to construct an alternative “intellectual–moral bloc” should take place under the auspices of the Communist Party—a body he described as the “modern prince.” Just as Niccolò Machiavelli hoped to see a prince unite Italy, rid the country of foreign barbarians, and create a virtù–ous state, Gramsci believed that the modern prince could lead the working class on its journey toward its revolutionary destiny of an emancipated society (Gramsci 1971: 125–205). Gramsci’s relative optimism about the possibility of progressive theorists playing a constructive role in emancipatory political practice was predicated on his belief in the existence of a universal class (a class whose emancipation would inevitably presage the emancipation of humanity itself) with revolutionary potential. It was a gradual loss of faith in this axiom that led Horkheimer and Adorno to their extremely pessimistic prognosis about the possibilities of progressive social change. But does a loss of faith in the revolutionary vocation of the proletariat necessarily lead to the kind of quietism ultimately embraced by the first generation of the Frankfurt School? The conflict that erupted in the 1960s between them and their more radical students suggests not. Indeed, contemporary critical theorists claim that the deprivileging of the role of the proletariat in the struggle for emancipation is actually a positive move. Class remains a very important axis of domination in society, but it is not the only such axis (Fraser 1995). Nor is it valid to reduce all other forms of domination—for example, in the case of gender—to class relations, as orthodox Marxists tend to do. To recognize these points is not only a first step toward the development of an analysis of forms of exploitation and exclusion within society that is more attuned to social reality; it is also a realization that there are other forms of emancipatory politics than those associated with class conflict.</r><a id="txt1"></a><r class="font5"> 1 This in turn suggests new possibilities and problems for emancipatory theory. Furthermore, the abandonment of faith in revolutionary parties is also a positive development. The history of the European left during the twentieth century provides myriad examples of the ways in which the fetishization of party organizations has led to bureaucratic immobility and the confusion of means with ends (see, for example, Salvadori 1990). The failure of the Bolshevik experiment illustrates how disciplined, vanguard parties are an ideal vehicle for totalitarian domination (Serge 1984). Faith in the “infallible party” has obviously been the source of strength and comfort to many in this period and, as the experience of the southern Wales coalfield demonstrates, has inspired brave and progressive behavior (see, for example, the account of support for the Spanish Republic in Francis 1984). But such parties have so often been the enemies of emancipation that they should be treated with the utmost caution. Parties are necessary, but their fetishization is potentially disastrous. </r><u>History furnishes examples of progressive developments that have been </u><r class="font5">positively </r><u>influenced by </u><r class="font5">organic </r><u>intellectuals operating outside the </u><r class="font5">bounds of a particular</r><u> party structure</u><r class="font5"> (G. Williams 1984). Some of these developments have occurred in the particularly intractable realm of security. These examples may be considered as “resources of hope” for critical security studies (R. Williams 1989). They illustrate that </r><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">ideas are important</r></r><r class="font5"><r class="highlighted"> or,</r> more correctly, that </r><r class="highlighted"><u>change is the product of the </u></r><u>dialectical </u><r class="highlighted"><u>interaction of ideas and material reality</u></r><u>. </u><r class="font5">One clear security–related example of the role of critical thinking and critical thinkers in aiding and abetting progressive social change is the experience of </r><u><r class="highlighted">the peace movement of the 1980s</r></u><r class="font5">. At that time the ideas of dissident </r><u>defense </u><r class="highlighted"><u>intellectuals</u></r><r class="font5"> (the “alternative defense” school) </r><u>encouraged</u><r class="font5"> and drew strength from </r><u>peace activism.</u><r class="font5"> Together </r><u>they </u><r class="highlighted"><u>had an effect </u></r><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">not only on short–term policy but on the </r>dominant <r class="highlighted">discourses of</r> </r><r class="font5">strategy and</r><u> </u><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">security</r></r><u>, a far more important result in the long run.</u><r class="font5"> </r><u>The synergy between </u><r class="font5">critical security</r><u> intellectuals and </u><r class="font5">critical </r><u>social movements </u><r class="font5">and the potential influence of both working in tandem </r><u>can be witnessed </u><r class="font5">particularly clearly</r><u> in the fate of common security. </u><r class="font5">As Thomas Risse–Kappen points out, the term “common security” originated in the contribution of peace researchers to the German security debate of the 1970s (Risse–Kappen 1994: 186ff.); it was subsequently popularized by the Palme Commission report (Independent Commission on Disarmament and Security Issues 1982). </r><r class="highlighted"><u>Initially</u></r><r class="font5">, mainstream </r><u>defense </u><r class="highlighted"><u>intellectuals dismissed the concept as</u></r><u> </u><r class="font5">hopelessly </r><r class="highlighted"><u>idealistic</u></r><r class="font5">; it certainly had no place in their allegedly hardheaded and realist view of the world.</r><u> </u><r class="highlighted"><u>However</u></r><u>, notions of common security were taken up by </u><r class="font5">a number of </r><u>different intellectual communities</u><r class="font5">, including the liberal arms control community in the United States, Western European peace researchers, security specialists in the center–left political parties of Western Europe, and Soviet “institutchiks”—members of the influential policy institutes in the Soviet Union such as the United States of America and Canada Institute (Landau 1996: 52–54; Risse–Kappen 1994: 196–200; Kaldor 1995; Spencer 1995). </r><u>These communities were subsequently able to take advantage of public pressure exerted through social movements in order to gain </u><r class="font5">broader </r><u>acceptance for common security</u><r class="font5">. In Germany, for example, “in response to social movement pressure, German social organizations such as churches and trade unions quickly supported the ideas promoted by peace researchers and the SPD” (Risse–Kappen 1994: 207). Similar </r><u>pressures even had an effect on the Reagan administration.</u><r class="font5"> As Risse–Kappen notes: When the Reagan administration brought hard–liners into power, the US arms control community was removed from policy influence. It was </r><u>the American peace movement</u><r class="font5"> and what became known as the “freeze campaign” that </r><u>revived the arms control process</u><r class="font5"> together with pressure from the European allies. (Risse–Kappen 1994: 205; also Cortright 1993: 90–110) Although it would be difficult to sustain a claim that the combination of critical movements and<strong> </strong></r><r class="highlighted"><strong><u>intellectuals</u></strong></r><r class="font5"> persuaded the Reagan government to adopt the rhetoric and substance of common security in its entirety, it is clear that it did at least </r><r class="highlighted"><strong><u>have a substantial impact on ameliorating U.S. behavior</u></strong></r><strong><u>. </u></strong><u>The most dramatic</u><r class="font5"> and certainly the most unexpected </r><u>impact of alternative defense ideas was felt in the Soviet Union</u><r class="font5">. Through various East–West links, which included arms control institutions, Pugwash conferences, interparty contacts, and even direct personal links, a coterie of Soviet policy analysts and advisers were drawn toward common security and such attendant notions as “nonoffensive defense” (these links are detailed in Evangelista 1995; Kaldor 1995; Checkel 1993; Risse–Kappen 1994; Landau 1996 and Spencer 1995 concentrate on the role of the Pugwash conferences). This group, including Palme Commission member Georgii Arbatov, Pugwash attendee Andrei Kokoshin, and Sergei Karaganov, a senior adviser who was in regular contact with the Western peace researchers Anders Boserup and Lutz Unterseher (Risse–Kappen 1994: 203), then influenced Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. Gorbachev’s subsequent championing of common security may be attributed to several factors. It is clear, for example, that new Soviet leadership had a strong interest in alleviating tensions in East–West relations in order to facilitate much–needed domestic reforms (“the interaction of ideas and material reality”). But what is significant is that </r><u>the Soviets’ commitment to common security led to significant changes in force sizes and postures</u><r class="font5">. These in turn aided in the winding down of the Cold War, the end of Soviet domination over Eastern Europe, and even the collapse of Russian control over much of the territory of the former Soviet Union. At the present time, in marked contrast to the situation in the early 1980s, common security is part of the common sense of security discourse. As MccGwire points out, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) (a common defense pact) is using the rhetoric of common security in order to justify its expansion into Eastern Europe (MccGwire 1997). This points to an interesting and potentially important aspect of the impact of ideas on politics. As concepts such as common security, and collective security before it (Claude 1984: 223–260), are adopted by governments and military services, they inevitably become somewhat debased. </r><u>The hope is that enough of the residual meaning can survive <r class="highlighted">to shift the parameters of the debate</r> in a potentially progressive direction. Moreover, the adoption of the concept of common security by official circles <r class="highlighted">provides critics with a useful tool for (</r></u><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">immanently) critiquing</r> aspects of <r class="highlighted">security policy</r></r><u> (as MccGwire 1997 demonstrates in relation to NATO expansion). <r class="highlighted">The</r> <r class="highlighted">example</r> of</u><r class="font5"> </r><u>common security </u><r class="font5">is highly instructive. First, it</r><u> </u><r class="highlighted"><u>indicates</u></r><u> that </u><r class="highlighted"><u>critical intellectuals can be politically engaged and</u></r><u> play a role—a significant one </u><r class="font5">at that—</r><u>in making the world </u><r class="font5">a </r><u>better</u><r class="font5"> and safer place. Second, it points to potential future addressees for critical international theory in general, and critical security studies in particular. Third, </r><u>it </u><r class="font5">also </r><u><r class="highlighted">underlines the role of ideas in the evolution of society</r>. </u><r class="font5">Although most proponents of critical security studies reject aspects of Gramsci’s theory of organic intellectuals, in particular his exclusive concentration on class and his emphasis on the guiding role of the party, the desire for engagement and relevance must remain at the heart of their project. The example of the peace movement suggests that </r><u>critical theorists can still play the role of organic intellectuals and that this organic relationship need not confine itself to a single class; it can involve alignment with different coalitions of social movements that campaign on an issue or a series of issues pertinent to the struggle for emancipation</u><r class="font5"> (Shaw 1994b; R. Walker 1994). Edward Said captures this broader orientation when he suggests that </r><u>critical <r class="highlighted">intellectuals</r> <r class="highlighted">“</r>are</u><r class="font5"> </r><u><r class="highlighted">always </r>tied </u><r class="font5">to </r><u>and </u><r class="font5">ought to </r><u><r class="highlighted">remain</r> <r class="highlighted">a</r></u><r class="font5">n organic </r><u><r class="highlighted">part of an </r></u><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">ongoing experience in society</r></r><r class="font5">: of the poor, the disadvantaged, the voiceless, the unrepresented, the powerless” (Said 1994: 84). </r><u>In the</u><r class="font5"> specific </r><u>case of critical security studies</u><r class="font5">, </r><u><r class="highlighted">this means placing the experience of</r> those men and <r class="highlighted">women</r></u><r class="font5"> and communities </r><u><r class="highlighted">for whom the present world order is a cause of insecurity</r> rather than security <r class="highlighted">at the center of the agenda</r></u><r class="font5"> </r><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">and making suffering humanity rather than raison d’état the prism through which problems are viewed.</r></r><r class="font5"> Here the project stands full–square within the critical theory tradition. </r><u><r class="highlighted">If “all theory is for someone</r> and for some purpose,” <r class="highlighted">then critical</r> security <r class="highlighted">studies is for “the</r></u><r class="font5"> </r><u>voiceless, the <r class="highlighted">unrepresented</r>, the powerless,” <r class="highlighted">and</r> <r class="highlighted">its purpose is</r> their <r class="highlighted">emancipation</r></u><r class="font5">. The theoretical implications of this orientation have already been discussed in the previous chapters. They involve a fundamental reconceptualization of security with a shift in referent object and a broadening of the range of issues considered as a legitimate part of the discourse. They also involve a reconceptualization of strategy within this expanded notion of security. But the question remains at the conceptual level of how these </r><u><r class="highlighted">alternative types</r></u><r class="highlighted"><u> of theorizing</u></r><r class="font5">—even if they are self–consciously aligned to the practices of critical or new social movements, such as peace activism, the struggle for human rights, and the survival of minority cultures—</r><r class="highlighted"><u>can become “a force for</u></r><u> the direction of </u><r class="highlighted"><u>action</u></r><u>.” </u><r class="font5">Again, Gramsci’s work is insightful. In the Prison Notebooks, Gramsci advances a sophisticated analysis of how </r><u><r class="highlighted">dominant discourses play a vital role in upholding</r></u><r class="font5"><r class="highlighted"> </r></r><u><r class="highlighted">particular political</r></u><r class="font5"> and economic </r><u><r class="highlighted">orders</r></u><r class="font5">, or, in Gramsci’s terminology, “historic blocs” (Gramsci 1971: 323–377). Gramsci adopted Machiavelli’s view of power as a centaur, half man, half beast: a mixture of consent and coercion. </r><u>Consent is</u><r class="font5"> produced and </r><u>reproduced by a</u><r class="font5"> ruling </r><u>hegemony</u><r class="font5"> that holds sway through civil society and </r><u>through which</u><r class="font5"> ruling or </r><u>dominant ideas become widely dispersed</u><r class="font5">. 2 In particular, Gramsci describes how </r><u>ideology </u><r class="font5">becomes sedimented in society and takes on the status of common sense; it </r><u>becomes subconsciously accepted</u><r class="font5"> </r><u>and even regarded as beyond question</u><r class="font5">. </r><strong><u>Obviously</u></strong><r class="font5">, for Gramsci, </r><r class="highlighted"><strong><u>there is nothing immutable about</u></strong></r><strong><u> the </u></strong><r class="highlighted"><strong><u>values</u></strong></r><strong><u> that permeate society; </u></strong><r class="highlighted"><strong><u>they</u></strong></r><strong><u> </u></strong><r class="highlighted"><strong><u>can and do change</u></strong></r><r class="font5"><strong>.</strong> In the social realm, </r><u>ideas and <r class="highlighted">institutions</r></u><r class="font5"> that were </r><u><r class="highlighted">once seen as</r> natural and <r class="highlighted">beyond question</r></u><r class="font5"> (i.e., commonsensical) in the West, </r><u><r class="highlighted">such as</r> feudalism and <r class="highlighted">slavery, are now</r> seen as anachronistic, unjust, and <r class="highlighted">unacceptable</r></u><r class="font5">. In Marx’s well–worn phrase, “All that is solid melts into the air.” Gramsci’s intention is to harness this potential for change and ensure that it moves in the direction of emancipation. To do this he suggests a strategy of a “war of position” (Gramsci 1971: 229–239). Gramsci argues that in states with developed civil societies, such as those in Western liberal democracies, </r><u>any successful attempt at </u><r class="font5">progressive </r><r class="highlighted"><strong><u>social change requires</u></strong></r><u> a </u><r class="font5">slow</r><u>, </u><strong><u>incremental</u></strong><u>, </u><r class="font5">even </r><r class="highlighted"><strong><u>molecular, struggle</u></strong></r><u> to break down the prevailing hegemony </u><r class="font5">and construct an alternative counterhegemony to take its place.

I contend that Gramsci’s strategy of a war of position suggests an appropriate model for proponents of critical security studies to adopt in relating their theorizing to political practice. The Tasks of Critical Security Studies If the project of critical security studies is conceived in terms of a war of position, then </r><u>the <r class="highlighted">main task of </r>those <r class="highlighted">intellectuals</r> who align themselves with the enterprise <r class="highlighted">is to</r> attempt to <r class="highlighted">undermine</r> the prevailing <r class="highlighted">hegemonic security discourse</r></u><r class="font5">. </r><r class="highlighted"><u>This may be</u></r><u> </u><r class="highlighted"><u>accomplished by</u></r><u> </u><r class="font5">utilizing specialist information and expertise to engage in an immanent</r><u> </u><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">critique of the prevailing</r></r><u> security</u><r class="font5"> </r><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">regimes</r></r><r class="font5">, </r><u>that is, </u><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">comparing the justifications of those regimes with actual outcomes</r></r><r class="font5">. </r><u>When this is attempted</u><r class="font5"> in the security field, </r><u><r class="highlighted">the</r></u><r class="font5"> prevailing structures and </r><u><r class="highlighted">regimes are found to </r></u><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">fail</r></r><u> </u><r class="font5">grievously</r><u> </u><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">on their own terms</r></r><r class="font5">. </r><u>Such an approach also involves</u><r class="font5"> </r><u><r class="highlighted">challenging</r> the pronouncements</u><r class="font5"> </r><u>of those <r class="highlighted">intellectuals</r></u><r class="font5">, traditional or organic, </r><u><r class="highlighted">whose views</r> serve to legitimate, and hence <r class="highlighted">reproduce, the prevailing world</r> <r class="highlighted">order</r>.</u><r class="font5"> </r><u>This challenge </u><r class="highlighted"><u>entails</u></r><r class="font5"> </r><u>teasing out</u><r class="font5"> the often subconscious and certainly unexamined </r><u>assumptions that underlie their arguments</u><r class="font5"> </r><u>while <r class="highlighted">drawing attention to the normative viewpoints </r>that are <r class="highlighted">smuggled into </r>mainstream <r class="highlighted">thinking about security</r> </u><r class="emphasis">behind its positivist facade.</r><r class="font5"> In this sense, proponents of critical security studies approximate to Foucault’s notion of “</r><u>specific intellectuals” </u><r class="font5">who </r><u>use their expert knowledge to challenge the prevailing “regime of truth</u><r class="font5">” (Foucault 1980: 132). However, critical theorists might wish to reformulate this sentiment along more familiar Quaker lines of “speaking truth to power” (this sentiment is also central to Said 1994) or even along the eisteddfod lines of speaking “truth against the world.” Of course, traditional strategists can, and indeed do, sometimes claim a similar role. Colin S. Gray, for example, states that “strategists must be prepared to ‘speak truth to power’” (Gray 1982a: 193). But the difference between Gray and proponents of critical security studies is that, </r><u><r class="highlighted">whereas the former seeks to influence policymakers</r> in</u><r class="font5"> </r><u>particular directions <r class="highlighted">without questioning</r> the basis of <r class="highlighted">their power, the latter aim at a</r></u><r class="font5"><r class="highlighted"> </r>thoroughgoing </r><u><r class="highlighted">critique of all that </r>traditional <r class="highlighted">security</r></u><r class="font5"><r class="highlighted"> </r></r><u><r class="highlighted">studies has taken for granted</r>. </u><r class="font5">Furthermore, critical theorists base their critique on the presupposition, elegantly stated by Adorno, that “the need to lend suffering a voice is the precondition of all truth” (cited in Jameson 1990: 66). </r><u>The aim of </u><r class="font5">critical </r><u>security studies in </u><r class="highlighted"><u>attempting to undermine</u></r><u> </u><r class="highlighted"><u>the</u></r><u> </u><r class="font5">prevailing </r><r class="highlighted"><u>orthodoxy is </u></r><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">ultimately educational</r></r><r class="font5">. As Gramsci notes, “Every relationship of ‘hegemony’ is necessarily a pedagogic relationship” (Gramsci 1971: 350; see also the discussion of critical pedagogy in Neufeld 1995: 116–121). Thus, </r><u>by criticizing </u><r class="font5">the </r><u>hegemonic discourse </u><r class="font5">and advancing alternative conceptions of security based on different understandings of human potentialities,</r><u> the approach is simultaneously playing a part in eroding the </u><r class="font5">legitimacy of the </r><u>ruling </u><r class="font5">historic </r><u>bloc and contributing to </u><r class="font5">the development of</r><u> a counterhegemonic position. </u><r class="font5">There are a number of avenues open to critical security </r><u>specialists</u><r class="font5"> in </r><u>pursuing this educational strategy</u><r class="font5">. </r><u>As </u><r class="highlighted"><u>teachers</u></r><u>, they </u><r class="highlighted"><u>can</u></r><u> try to </u><r class="highlighted"><u>foster</u></r><u> and encourage </u><r class="highlighted"><u>skepticism</u></r><u> toward accepted wisdom</u><r class="font5"> and open minds to other possibilities. They can also take advantage of the seemingly unquenchable thirst of the media for instant punditry to forward alternative views onto a broader stage. Nancy Fraser argues: “</r><u>As teachers, we try to foster an emergent pedagogical counterculture</u><r class="font5">.... As critical public intellectuals we try to inject our perspectives into whatever cultural or political public spheres we have access to” (Fraser 1989: 11). Perhaps significantly, support for this type of emancipatory strategy can even be found in the work of the ultrapessimistic Adorno, who argues: </r><u>In the history of civilization there have been not a few instances when delusions were healed not by focused propaganda, but, in the final analysis, because scholars, with their unobtrusive yet insistent work habits, studied what lay at the root of the delusion</u><r class="font5">. (cited in Kellner 1992: vii) Such “unobtrusive yet insistent work” does not in itself create the social change to which Adorno alludes. </r><u><r class="highlighted">The</r> conceptual and the practical <r class="highlighted">dangers of collapsing practice into theory must be guarded against</r>.</u><r class="font5"> Rather, </r><u><r class="highlighted">through</r> </u><r class="font5">their </r><u><r class="highlighted">educational activities</r></u><r class="font5">, </r><u>proponents of </u><r class="font5">critical </r><u>security studies should aim to provide support for those social movements that promote </u><r class="font5">emancipatory </r><u>social change</u><r class="font5">. </r><u>By providing<r class="highlighted"> a critique of the prevailing order</r></u><r class="font5"> and legitimating alternative views, </r><u>critical theorists <r class="highlighted">can perform a valuable role in </r>supporting the struggles of <r class="highlighted">social movements</r>. </u><r class="font5">That said, the role of theorists is not to direct and instruct those movements with which they are aligned; instead, the relationship is reciprocal. The experience of the European, North American, and Antipodean </r><u>peace movements of <r class="highlighted">the 1980s</r></u><r class="font5"> </r><u><r class="highlighted">shows how influential</r> social <r class="highlighted">movements can become when</r> their efforts are <r class="highlighted">harnessed to the intellectual</r> and educational <r class="highlighted">activity of critical</r> <r class="highlighted">thinkers</r></u><r class="font5">. For example, in his account of New Zealand’s antinuclear stance in the 1980s, Michael C. Pugh cites the importance of the visits of critical intellectuals such as Helen Caldicott and Richard Falk in changing the country’s political climate and encouraging the growth of the antinuclear movement (Pugh 1989: 108; see also Cortright 1993: 5–13). In the 1980s peace movements and critical intellectuals interested in issues of security and strategy drew strength and succor from each other’s efforts. If such critical social movements do not exist, then this creates obvious difficulties for the critical theorist. But even under these circumstances, the theorist need not abandon all hope of an eventual orientation toward practice. Once again, the peace movement of the 1980s provides evidence of the possibilities. At that time, the movement benefited from the intellectual work undertaken in the lean years of the peace movement in the late 1970s. Some of the theories and concepts developed then, such as common security and nonoffensive defense, were eventually taken up even in the Kremlin and played a significant role in defusing the second Cold War. Those ideas developed in the 1970s can be seen in Adornian terms of a “message in a bottle,” but in this case, contra Adorno’s expectations, they were picked up and used to support a program of emancipatory political practice. Obviously, one would be naive to understate the difficulties facing those attempting to develop alternative critical approaches within academia. Some of these problems have been alluded to already and involve the structural constraints of academic life itself. Said argues that many problems are caused by what he describes as the growing “professionalisation” of academic life (Said 1994: 49–62). Academics are now so constrained by the requirements of job security and marketability that they are extremely risk–averse. It pays—in all senses—to stick with the crowd and avoid the exposed limb by following the prevalent disciplinary preoccupations, publish in certain prescribed journals, and so on. The result is the navel gazing so prevalent in the study of international relations and the seeming inability of security specialists to deal with the changes brought about by the end of the Cold War (Kristensen 1997 highlights the search of U.S. nuclear planners for “new targets for old weapons”). And, of course, the pressures for conformism are heightened in the field of security studies when governments have a very real interest in marginalizing dissent. Nevertheless, </r><u>opportunities for critical thinking do exist,</u><r class="font5"> </r><u>and </u><r class="font5">this thinking can connect with the practices of social movements and </r><u>become a “force for the direction of action</u><r class="font5">.” The experience of </r><u>the 1980s, when,</u><r class="font5"> </r><u>in the depths of the second Cold War, <r class="highlighted">critical thinkers risked demonization</r></u><r class="font5"> and in some countries far worse in order </r><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">to challenge received wisdom</r></r><r class="font5">, thus arguably </r><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">playing a crucial role in the very survival of the human race</r></r><r class="font5">, should act as both an inspiration and a challenge to critical security studies.</r></p><br> <br> Card Number: 42<br> <br><h4>Interrogating the psychological underpinnings of enemy creation is the only solution </h4><p><strong>Byles 3</strong>—English, U Cyprus (Joanna, Psychoanalysis and War: The Superego and Projective Identification, http://www.clas.ufl.edu/ipsa/journal/articles/art_byles01.shtml)</p><p><u>The problem of warfare</u><r class="font7"> which includes genocide, and its most recent manifestation, international terrorism, </r><u>brings into focus the need to understand how the individual is placed in the social</u><r class="font7"> </r><u>and the social in the individual</u><r class="font7">. </r><u>Psychoanalytic theories</u><r class="font7"> of superego aggression, splitting, projection, and projective identification </r><u>may be useful in helping us to understand the psychic links involved</u><r class="font7">. </r><u>It seems vital</u><r class="font7"> to me writing in the Middle East in September 2002 that </r><u>we examine our understanding</u><r class="font7"> </r><u>of what it is we understand about war,</u><r class="font7"> including genocide and terrorism. </r><u>Some psychoanalysts argue that war is a necessary defence against psychotic anxiety</u><r class="font7"> (Fornari xx; Volkan), and Freud himself first advanced the idea that war provided an outlet for repressed impulses. ("Why War?"197). </r><u>The problematic of these views is the individual's need to translate internal psychotic anxieties into real external dangers so as to control them</u><r class="font7">. </r><u>It suggests</u><r class="font7"> that culturally </r><u><r class="highlighted">warfare</r> </u><r class="font7">and its most recent manifestation, international terrorism and the so-called ''war on terrorism," </r><u><r class="highlighted">may be a </r>necessary <r class="highlighted">object for internal aggression and not a pathology</r>. </u><r class="font7">Indeed, Fornari suggests that "war could be seen as an attempt at therapy, carried out by a social institution which, precisely by institutionalizing war, increases to gigantic proportions what is initially an elementary defensive mechanism of the ego in the schizo-paranoid phase" (xvii-xviii). In other words, </r><u>the history of <r class="highlighted">war might represent the externalization</r></u><r class="font7"> and articulation </r><u><r class="highlighted">of </r>shared unconscious <r class="highlighted">fantasies</r></u><r class="font7">. This idea would suggest that </r><u>the culture of war,</u><r class="font7"> genocide, and international terrorism </r><u>provides objects of psychic need</u><r class="font7">. </r><u>If this is so, with what can we replace them? If</u><r class="font7"> cultural formations and historical events have their sources in our psychic functioningthat is to say, in our unconscious fears and desires, and culture itself provides a framework for expressing, articulating, and coming to terms with these fears and desires, then </r><u>psychoanalysis may help to reveal why war seems to be an inevitable and ineradicable part of human history. </u><r class="font7">Superego as an Agent of Aggression In "The Ego and the Id," Freud formulated a seemingly insoluble dilemma in the very essence of the human psyche; the eternal conflict between the dual instincts of eros, the civilizing life instinct, and the indomitable death instinct (thanatos). He also identified some aspects of the death instinct with superego aggression, suggesting that the superego was the agent of the death instinct in its cruel and aggressive need for punishment and that its operative feeling was frequently a punitive hatred, while other aspects of the superego were protective. As we know, Freud thought the source of the superego was the internalization of the castrating Oedipal father. In chapter seven of Civilization and its Discontents, he theorized that when de-fusion or separation of the dual instincts occurred, aspects of aggression frequently dominated and that it was the purpose of the ego to find objects for eros and/or aggression either in phanta sv or reality. The role phantasy plays in projective identification is something to which I shall return. Other theorists, such as Melanie Klein, trace the beginning of the superego back to early (infant) oral phantasies of self-destruction, which is a direct manifestation of the death instinct. Klein transformed the oedipal drama by making the mother its central figure and thus playing a vital role in object-relations theory, about which I shall say more later in this essay. Although Klein's work relied on the dual instinct theory postulated by Freud, she re-defined the drives by emphasizing the way in which the destructive instincts attached themselves to the object, in particular the good-bad breast. Thus for Klein, the site of the superego is derived from oral Incorporation of the good/bad breast, contrary to Freud, for whom the site of the superego is the paternal law. Although the formation of the superego is grounded on the renunciation ofloving and hostile Oedipal wishes, it is subsequently refined, by the contributions of social and cultural requirements (education, religion, morality). My argument in this paper is three-fold: (1) These social and cultural requirements in which the superego is grounded may be used by the superego of the state and/or its leader to mobilize aspects of the individual's aggression during war-time in a way that does not happen in peace-time. (2) Klein's theory of </r><u><r class="highlighted">splitting</r> and projective identification <r class="highlighted">plays an important role in the concept of </r>difference and <r class="highlighted">otherness </r>as enemy</u><r class="font7">. (3) Bion's development of Klein's theory into what he called the "container" and the "contained" may offer some way out of the psychic dangers of projective identification by suggesting that </r><u>we may be able to access our internal psychic world as a transformative power to combat violence both internal and external.</u><r class="font7"> In an early attempt to define war neuroses, or how war mentally traumatizes the psyche, Freud wrote of the conflict "between the soldier's old peaceful ego and his new warlike one" becoming acute as soon as the peace-ego realizes what danger it runs in losing its own life to the rashness of its newly formed parasitic double" (SE 17 209). Accepting the violence that is within ourselves as well as in the other, the so-called enemy, is a difficult lesson to learn, and learning to displace our instinctual destructive aggression peacefully is enormously more difficult. To the extent the individual superego is connected to society, which assumes its functions particularly in wartime, the problem of war brings into focus the psychoanalytic problem of the partial defusion (separation) of eros and psychic aggression brought about by war through specifically social processes. These social processes involve the mechanisms by which aspects of the violent and aggressive social superego of the State mobilizes and appropriates some of the dynamic aspects of the individual's superego aggression: the need to hate, and to punish, for its own purposes, such as genocide or so-called "ethnic cleansing," and for territorial and economic reasons. Many of these actions are often masked as defending civilization, or an idealized State and/or its leader. This is also true of the "holy jihads" that are rapidly becoming an enormous threat to the world. In his book Enemies and Allies, Vamik Volkan suggests that the individual may see the superego of the State as his/her own idealized superego. And indeed, this may in turn help to explain how during war-time the social superego is placed in the individual and how in turn the individual is positioned in the social. In Civilization and its Discontents, to which I have already referred, Freud wrote about the ways in which the regulations and demands of a civilized society harbor the risk of the death instinct (aggression) being released at any favorable opportunity, especially when combined with Eros i.e., under the pretext of idealism and patriotism. This is especially true when t here is a leader who elicits strong emotional attachments from a group or nation. Of course, </r><u>I am not arguing</u><r class="font7"> that </r><u>there are not</u><r class="font7"> some </r><u>important aspects of the</u><r class="font7"> </r><u>social superego that are beneficial</u><r class="font7">, </r><u>for example</u><r class="font7"> the </r><u>ethical and moral laws</u><r class="font7"> which shape society and protect its citizens; </r><u>nevertheless</u><r class="font7">, </r><u>in wartime</u><r class="font7"> and its most recent manifestation, international terrorism, </r><u>it is precisely these civilizing aspects of the social superego that are </u><r class="font7">ignored or </r><u>repressed</u><r class="font7">. It seems to me that the </r><u><r class="highlighted">failure </r>of civilization historically <r class="highlighted">to control</r></u><r class="font7"> the aggression, cruelty, and hatred that characterize </r><u><r class="highlighted">war</r> </u><r class="font7">urgently </r><u><r class="highlighted">requires a psychoanalytic explanation</r></u><r class="font7">. Of course, I am speaking of psychic, not biological (survival of the fittest), aggression. </r><u>In wartime the externalized superego of the state sanctions killing </u><r class="font7">and violence that is </r><u>not allowed in peace-time</u><r class="font7"> (in fact, such violence against others during peacetime would be considered criminal) </r><u>sanctions</u><r class="font7">, in fact, </r><u>the gratification of warring aggression</u><r class="font7">, thus </r><u>ensuring </u><r class="font7">that acts of </r><u>violence need not incur guilt.</u><r class="font7"> Why do we accept this? Psychoanalysis posits the idea that </r><u>aggression is not behavioral but instinctual; not social but psychological</u><r class="font7">. To quote Volkan, who follows Freud, "It is man's very nature itself." Obviously, </r><u>it is vital that humanity find more mature</u><r class="font7">, less primitive </r><u>ways of dealing with our</u><r class="font7"> hatred and </r><u>aggression than war</u><r class="font7">, genocide, and international terrorism. </r><u>The most characteristic thing about</u><r class="font7"> this kind of </r><u>violence </u><r class="font7">and cruelty </r><u>is its collective mentality</u><r class="font7">: war requires group co-operation, organization, and approval. Some theorists argue that </r><u>one of the primary cohesive elements binding individuals into institutionalized</u><r class="font7"> human </r><u>association is defence against psychotic anxiety.</u><r class="font7"> In Group Psychology Freud writes that "</r><u>in a group the individual is brought under conditions which allow him to throw off the repressions of his unconscious instinctual</u><r class="font7"> </r><u>impulses</u><r class="font7">. </r><u>The apparently new characteristics he then displays are</u><r class="font7"> in fact the </r><u>manifestation of this unconscious, in which all that is evil in the human mind is contained as a predisposition"</u><r class="font7"> (74). Later in the same essay, when speaking of the individual and the group mind, Freud quotes Le Bon : "Isolated, he may be a cultivated individual; in a crowd, he is a barbarian that is, a creature acting by instinct. He possesses the spontaneity, the violence, the ferocity, and also the enthusiasm and heroism of primitive beings" (77). </r><u>War </u><r class="font7">is a collective phenomenon that mobilizes our anxieties and </r><u>allows our original sadistic fantasies of destructive omnipotence to be re-activated and projected onto "the enemy."</u><r class="font7"> </r><u>Some critics have argued that we "need" enemies as external</u><r class="font7"> </r><u>stabilizers of our sense of identity</u><r class="font7"> and inner control. It has also been argued that the militancy a particular group shows toward its </r><u><r class="highlighted">enemies</r> </u><r class="font7">may partly </r><u><r class="highlighted">mask</r> the personal <r class="highlighted">internal conflicts </r>of each member of the group</u><r class="font7">, </r><u>and </u><r class="font7">that </r><u>they </u><r class="font7">may </r><u>therefore</u><r class="font7"> </r><u>have an emotional investment in</u><r class="font7"> the maintenance of the </r><u>enmity</u><r class="font7">. In other words, </r><u><r class="highlighted">they need the enemy and are </r>unconsciously <r class="highlighted">afraid to lose it</r><r class="font6"><r class="highlighted">. </r></r><r class="highlighted">This fits in with the</r><r class="font6"> </r></u><r class="font7">well known </r><u><r class="highlighted">phenomenon of inventing an enemy when there is not one</r> readily<r class="font6"> </r><r class="highlighted">available</r></u><r class="font7">. The individual suicide bomber, or suicide pilot, is just as much part of this group psychology each bomber, each terrorist, is acting for his/her group, or even more immediately his or her family, from whom he/she derives enormous psychic strength and support. Just as importantly, she/he is acting in the name of his/her leader. All of these identifications require strong emotional attachments. Freud writes, "The mutual tie between members of a group is in the nature of an identification, based upon an important emotional common quality. . . . This common quality lies in the nature of the tie to the leader" (Group 1078). In Learning from Experience, Bion theorizes that a social groupfunctions to establish a fixed social order of things (the establishm ent), and that the individual has to be contained by the establishment of the group. Sometimes the rigidity of me system crushes the individual's creativity; alternatively, certain special individuals erupt in the group, which goes to pieces under their influence (Bion cites Jesus within the constraints of Israel). A final possibility is the mutual adaptation of one to the other, with a development of both the individual and the group. The development of a sense of self, its integration, its separation, and its protection all begin, or course, in early childhood. Psychoanalyses like Klein, Winnicott, and Bion have explored these ideas in what is known as object relations theory. Volkan writes that the </r><u>concepts of enemy and ally</u><r class="font7"> and the senses of ethnicity and nationality </r><u>are </u><r class="font7">largely </r><u>bound up with the individual's sense of self</u><r class="font7">, and that individuals within an ethnic or national group tend to see their group as a privileged "pseudo-species" (Erikson) and enemy groups as subhuman (262). </r><u>Of course enemies are threatening and do generate a reactive need for defenses; however, a basic psychoanalytic question might be to what extent the degree of defensiveness characteristic of <r class="highlighted">war </r>behavior <r class="highlighted">represents </r>personal</u><r class="font7">, emotional </r><u><r class="highlighted">need</r>s of individuals <r class="highlighted">for an enemy</r> to hate</u><r class="font7">, </r><u><r class="highlighted">so</r> that <r class="highlighted">they can keep their </r>conflicted <r class="highlighted">selves together</r></u><r class="font7">, </r><u>and to what extent the State superego plays a role here. Our capacity for splitting and projection plays an important part in how</u><r class="font7"> </r><u>we </u><r class="font7">see others and </r><u>feel about others</u><r class="font7">, and through the process of projective identification, how we make others feel about ourselves and themselves. </r><u>Projective identification</u><r class="font7"> </r><u>involves </u><r class="font7">a deep split, </r><u>displacing onto </u><r class="font7">and into </r><u>others the hateful</u><r class="font7">, bad </r><u>parts of ourselves</u><r class="font7">, and frequently making them feehateful to themselves through their own introjection of our hatred. This hatred is often racial or religious, frequently both. Moreover, in the process of projective identification, parts of the self are put into the other, thus depleting the ego. (This process can be a vicious circle, and it is a profoundly disturbing and characteristic pathology, often involving envy and/or rivalry, both corrosive, poisonous forces.) </r><u>These </u><r class="font7">Kleinian </r><u>ideas</u><r class="font7">, developed by other theorists, such as Winnicott and Bion, </r><u>are hugely relevant to </u><r class="font7">the problem of </r><u>war</u><r class="font7"> and genocide, and most recently, of terrorism. Klein argues that </r><u><r class="highlighted">in the paranoid </r>schizoid <r class="highlighted">position there is </r>a <r class="highlighted">splitting </r>of good and bad objects</u><r class="font7">, </r><u>with the good being introjected and the bad being externalized</u><r class="font7"> and projected out into someone or onto something else. As with the infant and child, so with the adult, </r><u>mechanisms of splitting and protection play upon negative and feared connotations </u><r class="font7">of the other, </r><u>of the enemy</u><r class="font7">, and of difference;</r><u> <r class="highlighted">projection prevents </r>warring <r class="highlighted">nations from</r> exploring and thus <r class="highlighted">understanding what</r> it is that actually <r class="highlighted">divides them</r>; it prevents mutual response and recognition by promoting exclusivity. </u><r class="font7">As already mentioned, analysts such as Volkan and Erikson have written about the processes by which an </r><u>enemy is dehumanized</u><r class="font7"> so as </r><u>to provide the distance a group needs from its perceived enemy</u><r class="font7">. First </r><u>the group becomes preoccupied with the</u><r class="font7"> </r><u>enemy according to the psychology of minor differences</u><r class="font7">. Then </r><u>mass regression occurs to permit</u><r class="font7"> </r><u>the group to</u><r class="font7"> recover and </r><u>reactivate more primitive methods</u><r class="font7">. </r><u>What they then use in this regressed state tends to contain</u><r class="font7"> aspects of </r><u>childish </u><r class="font7">(pre-oedipal) </r><u>fury. The enemy is perceived more and more as a stereotype of bad and negative qualities</u><r class="font7">. The use of </r><u><r class="highlighted">denial allows a group to ignore the fact that </r>its own <r class="highlighted">externalizations </r>and projections <r class="highlighted">are involved in this process</r></u><r class="font7">. The stereotyped enemy may be so despised as to be no longer human, and it will then be referred to in non-human terms. History teaches us that it was in </r><u>this way that the Nazis perceived the Jews</u><r class="font7"> </r><u>as vermin to be exterminated</u><r class="font7">. As I write, Al Qaeda terrorist groups view all Americans as demons and infidels to be annihilated, and many </r><u>Americans are comforted by demonizing all of bearded</u><r class="font7"> </r><u>Islam</u><r class="font7">. Many Israelis consider most Palestinians as dirt beneath their feet subhuman and most Palestinians think of most Israelis as despoilers of the land they are supposed to share.

We might substitute for the libidinal object-ties involved in projective identification the re-introjection of the object into the ego, and thus reach a common feeling of sharing, of being part of the other, of empathy, in short. As Freud pointed our, the ego is altered bv introjection, as suggested by his memorable formulation: " The shadow of the object has fallen on the ego." In his book Second Thoughts, Bion theorizes that in the infant as in the adult, re-introjection can be dangerous if the dominance of projective identification confuses the distinction between s elf and the external object, since this awareness depends on the recognition of a distinction between subject and object. But Bion's theory of the pairing group, or the container and the contained, provides a way out of this predicament, suggesting that the outcome of such pairing is either detrimental to the contained, or to the container, or mutually developing to both. This idea is germane to my argument in this paper that the reciprocity of the container and the contained relationship, through both positive projective identification (empathy) and introjection or re</r><u>-introjection, results in a positive allowance of difference</u><r class="font7"> in other words, </r><u>a healthy acceptance of and adaptation to the other within the self and the self within the other</u><r class="font7">. </r></p><br> <br> Card Number: 43<br> <br><h4>Reject the affirmative---this is crucial to open up individual space for resistance against security </h4><p>Anthony <strong>Burke 2</strong>, School of Political Science and International Studies, University of Queensland, 2002 Alternatives: Global, Local, Political 27.1 page InfoTrac OneFile</p><p><r class="font7">It is perhaps easy to become despondent, but </r><u>as countless struggles for freedom, justice, and social transformation have proved, a sense of seriousness can be tempered with the knowledge that many tools are already available--and where they are not, the effort to create a productive new critical sensibility is well advanced. <r class="highlighted">There is</r></u><r class="font7"> also </r><u><r class="highlighted">a crucial political opening within the</r> liberal <r class="highlighted">problematic</r> itself, in the sense that it assumes that <r class="highlighted">power is most effective when it is absorbed</r> as truth, consented to and desired--<r class="highlighted">which creates an important space for refusal</r></u><r class="font7">.

(61 ) Just as security rules subjectivity as both a totalizing and individualizing blackmail and promise, it is at these levels that we can intervene. </r><u><r class="highlighted">We can</r> critique the machinic frameworks of possibility represented by law, policy, economic regulation, and diplomacy, while <r class="highlighted">challeng</r>ing <r class="highlighted">the way </r>these <r class="highlighted">institutions deploy language to draw </r>individual <r class="highlighted">subjects into their </r>consensual <r class="highlighted">web.

This is especially evident in the case of major crimes. The road that was opened in Nuremberg35 has now taken us to Rome, where in July 1998 the approval of the statutes of the per- manent International Criminal Court would not have been possible without a wide global consensus on the moral/legal responsibility of individuals who serve their state in different capacities but who, by so doing, are in no way exempt from ethical scrutiny and legal sanction. ¶ It would be untenable to maintain that diplomats are exempt from such scrutiny (and sanctions), and that the mandate of the International Criminal Court covers only the actual physical purveyors of violence. </r><u><r class="highlighted">It would</r> </u><r class="font6">indeed </r><u><r class="highlighted">be a bizarre limitation</r></u><r class="font6">, especially </r><u><r class="highlighted">in a world in which the distinction between military action and diplomacy is</r> more and more <r class="highlighted">blurred</r> <r class="highlighted">in the</r> <r class="highlighted">framework of complex conflictive situations</r></u><r class="font6">; all the more so since the mandate of the court includes (though for the time being still wanting a definition) the crime of aggression, one in which diplomats can play as big a role as soldiers.36 ¶ How can we square the contradictory needs of impersonal bureaucratic discipline and persistent moral responsibility? The fact is that we cannot. The fact is that there must be a limit, a certain threshold beyond which¶ 56¶ the duty of allegiance and obedience is overruled, annulled by the moral outrage of certain acts in which the individual ``servant of the state'' is instructed to participate. The ethics of the public servant (with its corol- lary of obedience, of non-personalization of behaviour and choices) can take us only so far. A morally sane human being should be capable of determining when that limit is reached, when one must be able to breach one's allegiance and say ``no'' to the crossing of that threshold. ¶ It is necessary to recall that decisions to rebel against orders that are legitimate as to the line of command but that become illegitimate by their moral unacceptability are de®nitely not unheard of in the annals of diplomacy. Several historians of the Holocaust have stressed the role (sometimes merely passive, often active) of Italians, of®cially allied with the Germans, in saving thousands of Jews from detention and deporta- tion to death camps.37 Among those Italians were many military of®cers, but also several diplomats. Though the policy of the highest levels of fascist Italy, starting from Mussolini himself, was often wavering, contra- dictory, and ambiguous, there is no doubt that on many occasions Italian diplomats, in particular in the Balkans, proceeded totally on their own to perform acts of political indiscipline and to infringe very basic bureau- cratic rules, for instance by giving Italian passports to Jews whose only link with Italy was having visited it once: a rather serious breach of the ethics of an of®cial and one that would make any self-respecting consu- lar of®cer cringe. 38 In an unforgettable interview (included in Joseph Rochlitz's documentary The Righteous Enemy), the former Italian consul in Salonica, Guelfo Zamboni, replied in a half-surprised, half-amused tone to the interviewer, amazed at this most unusual concession of pass- ports to aliens: ``Well, they were in danger of death, weren't they? So, what was I supposed to do, let them be deported and exterminated?''39 ¶ The threshold at which personal assessment of moral duties becomes destructive of the ethics of the public servant is not a clearly defined line. Each - but that of course is no news in ethical discourse - has to draw that line and act accordingly. Certainly, if we were to allow the possibility for each diplomat to turn personal disagreement and mental reservation on any given issue into undisciplined behaviour and active rebellion we would revert to that individualistic free-for-all that is the antithesis of a functioning polis, even the most open and pluralistic one. And yet, there is always, even in cases that are not as monumentally horrendous as the Holocaust, a path for a digni®ed stand in the presence of radical moral disagreement with speci®c policies. In those cases one can avoid taking the extreme, always-questionable step of breaking loyalty by opting out ± by resignation. Of course, in non-democratic regimes such an act can entail consequences that may be as dire as those provoked by open re- bellion, but outside those regimes resigning means losing income, pres-¶ 57¶ tige, and career, but not life or freedom. Thus it becomes more feasible. But where has it happened more frequently, in the past decades? It seems not without signi®cance to note that it is in the USA that many diplomats have resigned (over policy issues from Viet Nam to Bosnia), a country whose citizens give a special relevance to debate on ethical issues and at the same time are frequently haunted by the awareness of the respon- sibility that their government's actions or omissions entail in terms of human consequences around the world. </r><u>To be able to raise ethical issues in diplomacy you </u><r class="font6">indeed </r><u>need</u><r class="font6"> both: </r><u>moral sensitivity,</u><r class="font6"> and </r><u>the perception of the impact on human beings outside your borders of the power wielded by your country</u><r class="font6"> in the international arena. ¶ If there is this sort of ``ethical switch'' that can interrupt allegiance to the state in the case of moral dissent, wouldn't it be safer for a state, any state, to privilege staunch nationalists as their diplomats, at least in the highest-ranking positions? Wouldn't they be more reliable in all con- ditions and facing any sort of problem, any sort of dilemma? The fallacy of this sort of reasoning lies in forgetting what a government of®cial is supposed to be. It is true that public servants are not justi®ed in sacri®c- ing their loyalty to the state and their disciplined behaviour within their administrations to the vagaries of personal taste, nor to political inclina- tions, local partiality, or special interests. However, by the same token it is not necessary, and even counterproductive, that they should be mili- tants of the nation-state, true believers in king and country. They can be such as citizens, but no one demands that they be such as of®cials. The confusion between the two roles (citizen and of®cial) is typically totali- tarian, and amounts to saying that the only good lawyers are those who believe that their clients are innocent ± and possibly love them, too. ¶ Going back to diplomats, we indeed see that if we cast them as lawyers, and not as crusaders for the cause of their own nation-state, we will have solved part of our ethical dilemmas. Diplomats involved in a negotiation or dispute, no more than lawyers in court, do not have to believe in the righteousness of the cause they are defending. That is the essence of professionalism, a much more reliable foundation for good performance and loyalty than is belief. But the diplomat, as well as the lawyer, may decide at a certain point that there are some causes that are just too morally uncomfortable to defend, and opt out. It is of course easier to abandon litigation than to resign from government service, but concep- tually there do not seem to be radical moral differences between the two instances. Both are rare, but both are possible. ¶ The ethical dimension of diplomacy, however, should not be seen only in negative terms ± as a limit to bureaucratic allegiance, as a moral safety valve allowing us to escape complicity with morally outrageous actions</r><u>. </u><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">The assumption one should challenge</r></r><r class="font6">, in this context, </r><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">is that of a</r></r><u> ``</u><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">status</r></r><r class="font6"> ¶ 58¶ </r><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">quo diplomatic system''</r></r><r class="font6">.40 Actually, </r><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">status quo leaves very limited room for ethical discourse</r></r><u>, <r class="highlighted">since it confronts the individual actor with the stark alternative between playing by the existing rules or </r>becoming a </u><r class="font6">sort of </r><u>conscientious objector and <r class="highlighted">dropping out of the ``regular'' game.

In that context, <u><r class="highlighted">they sought to articulate a narrative of Western unity, and disseminate it as widely as possible</r></u> in the countries of the Atlantic Alliance. As Erik Ringmar has argued, identities are constructed, maintained, and transformed via the telling of “constitutive” narratives.12 <u><r class="highlighted">Narratives provide a set of meanings within which an actor’s identity</r></u>, the situation within which they are located and the actions deemed appropriate are brought together.13 The process of telling constitutive narratives is especially important during periods of fundamental transformation, when new identities are being formed and old ones are being pressured to evolve.14 <u><r class="highlighted">In the eyes of Western leaders, the narrative of unity among NATO members had to not only cultivate a sense of shared identity, but also to delegitimize—by casting them as inconsistent with Western identity—communist forces</r> </u>that were becoming increasingly powerful in many allied states. Once again, some of the most influential voices in favour of disseminating a narrative of Western unity and using that to legitimize community-building practices within NATO were its middle powers—particularly Canada. For instance, the Canadian Foreign Minister, Lester Pearson, repeatedly argued in the early 1950s that NATO’s long-term goal had to be the creation of a community of free nations in the Atlantic area. More broadly, Canadian officials, together with NATO supporters from Norway, the Netherlands, Denmark, and the UK, were acutely aware of the fact that, in order for the alliance to be able to help build “a community of free nations” united around liberal values, it had to find a way to help publics from allied states transcend recent memories of war among Western states. What was required, in other words, was a collective reinterpretation—and a selective forgetting—of the recent past.15 After all, the newly identified enemy, communist Soviet Union, had emerged from the war as a hero in the eyes of many in the West. <u><r class="highlighted">The view of the “West as one” became central to a collective (re)reading of Western history following the establishment of the alliance.16 Collective efforts at history (re)writing found expression not only within the public discourse articulated by NATO, but also in confidential documents</r></u>. Recently declassified documents from the 1950s reveal a set of shared understandings among NATO’s decision-makers regarding the way in which the history of member states should be interpreted in order to foster a sense of Western community. In addition, <u><r class="highlighted">NATO mobilized its substantial material and symbolic power to widely disseminate the discourse on Western unity</r></u> in all the allied states and, simultaneously, <u><r class="highlighted">to delegitimize alternative readings of history</r></u>—especially those that focused on ideas of solidarity—and memories of friendship—with the Soviet Union.17 In particular, as Patrick Jackson has demonstrated, <u><r class="highlighted">the discourse of Western civilization played a key role</r></u> in orchestrating the collective (re)reading of Germany as a member of the Western community, and on this basis legitimating its incorporation into NATO. This is not to suggest that the West was an essential entity that objectively determined a field of outcomes. Rather, “<u><r class="highlighted">Western civilization” needs to be understood as “rhetorical commonplace,” used by allied policymakers as a discursive resource for de-legitimating policy options</r></u> opposed to Germany’s incorporation into American-led institutions.18 In the official NATO discourse, Germany was interpreted as a member of the Western family that, under the Nazi regime, had temporarily deviated from its core values. Following the end of that regime, however, (West) Germany—acting under the close supervision of allied states—could and should be reintegrated into the Euro-Atlantic community. Against the background of the constitutive discourse on Western unity, disagreements and tensions that continued to occur among member states could be represented as “family” feuds, and managed within the framework of shared norms and a persisting sense of community. A full analysis of inter-allied disagreements during the Cold War is beyond the scope of this paper. However, it is worthwhile to briefly examine what could be seen as one of the most significant set of disagreements within NATO: arguments concerning the accession to the alliance of states that did not comply with the liberal-democratic norms and values around which the Western community defined itself. Particularly interesting were arguments over the inclusion of Portugal in 1949, as well as the accession of Greece and especially Turkey (completed in 1952). In that context, middle powers like Canada and Norway emerged as strong proponents of the view that countries which did not respect basic liberal-democratic values did not belong—and should not be included—in the alliance which represented the Western community.19 In the end, however, all the allies were persuaded to support the inclusion of those “problem” countries. Several factors were crucial to the emergence of that consensus: a shared recognition among the allies of the geostrategic importance of those countries in the context of growing confrontation with the Soviet Union, and a sense that, in that particular context, the inclusion of strategically vital but normatively deviant states was an acceptable compromise in the name of protecting the community of liberal values. The prevailing view came to be that the integration of states like Portugal and Turkey could be managed in a way that would not necessarily endanger the core values of the West. Furthermore, inclusion into the Western community was seen by some allied policymakers as a course of action that could help those countries evolve into stable liberal democracies. It is revealing, in fact, that a normative compromise that was eventually seen as reasonable in the cases of Portugal and Turkey was regarded as inappropriate in the case of a country whose political regime was perceived as an active threat to liberal-democratic values: Franco’s Spain.20 As Mark Smith put it, “Turkey could be accommodated, and Portugal’s dictatorship had less Fascistic origins than Spain’s. Significantly, neither had a history of active antagonism toward Western European liberalism. Admitting Franco would be admitting a regime of the very sort that had overturned European democracy in the 1930s and 1940s, and as such was wholly unacceptable.”21 The end of the Cold War was accompanied by a sense of triumph by the West over its defining other, and, as a corollary to this, a shared view among allied decision-makers that a new security environment was emerging in Europe. In a context marked by the breakdown of the Soviet bloc and the eruption of violence linked to ethnic conflict and the breakdown of states (most notably in the former Yugoslavia), there was a shift away from definitions of security focused on military power, and toward a heavy emphasis on “good governance” within states. In essence, <u><r class="highlighted">security came to be associated with the liberal-democratic norms and institutions</r></u>; negatively, <u><r class="highlighted">risks came to be seen as emerging from the absence of liberal-democratic structures</r></u>.<a href="javascript:popRef('fn23-0020702019834645')">22</a> <u><r class="highlighted">In a situation in which there was no clearly identified enemy</r></u> state, but in which developments within the transient former communist countries threatened to undermine international security, <u><r class="highlighted">a consensus emerged that the promotion of “good” liberal-democratic norms and institutions within those states would be vital for European and international security in the new era.</r></u></p><br> <br> Card Number: 47<br> <br><h4>NATOs core identity is the expression and military guarantor of Western civilization – continually heightening threat perceptions and producing foundational narratives of collective unity toward a common purpose of securitization</h4><p>Gabi <strong>Schlag</strong> Re-constituting NATO: Foundational Narratives of Transatlantic Security Cooperation in the 1950s and 1990s.

Hence, the key shortcoming of realist, liberal, and institutionalist approaches to NATO is that they take the actor’s articulations of threats and interests at face value, while a critical approach directs our attention to how actors invoke threats, interest, and identities and to what kind of institutional consequences are made possible by these acts (Klein, 1990, pp. 315, 317; Jackson, 2003, p. 224). Such a perspective on the usage of concepts and their meaning is interested in the ways and forms of inscribing plots, characters, relations, and motives for action. As Trine Flockhart (2012, p. 80) writes, <u><r class="highlighted">‘[n]arratives describe the history, purpose and achievements of a collective entity such as NATO, and they contribute in the process towards its unity and facilitate its continuous transformation</r></u>’. These I will call foundational narratives. Foundational refers to two related aspects characteristic of most political narratives: first, it directs our attention to the justifications why something exists. In NATO’s case this refers to the justifications mobilized by the allies in order to found and keep an ‘alliance’, i.e. to construct meaningful stories about what ‘NATO’ is and how its past, present, and future are to be described. <u><r class="highlighted">Foundational narratives are answers to ‘why’- questions – questions such as ‘why do we still need NATO?’. Second, the term ‘foundational’ emphasizes the taken-for-grantedness of these narrative</r></u>s. Narratives are foundational when they restore unity in the light of (more or less) serious ‘identity crises’ where constructions of common representations appear as problematic. References to a ‘global war on terrorism’, for example, where military intervention and preemption is articulated as necessary, altered the organizational design of NATO in many ways. <u><r class="highlighted">Within these discursive patterns the continuing relevance of a transatlantic alliance was never really questioned, irrespective of whether NATO was defined as a system of collective defense or a forum for political consultation.

This seems to move away from one of the prominent critiques of, in Anna Agathangelou and Ling’s (2009) words, the ‘neoliberal imperium,’ as reliant on Western, liberal notions of governance to the detriment of those on whom such a form of government is imposed. Burke clearly problematizes this imposition, framing many of the serious problems in global politics as a result of ‘choices that create destructive dynamics and constraints’ (p. 15) at least in part by Western, liberal governments – characterizing modernity as culpable for insecurity. </r><u>At the same time, <r class="highlighted">the solution seems</r> to be clearly </u><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">situated within the discursive framework of the problem</r>.</r><r class="font8"> Burke suggests that there should be a primary concern for ‘effectiveness, equality, fairness, and justice – not for states, per se, but for human beings, and the global biosphere’ (p. 24). Unless the only problem with modernity is the post- Westphalian structure of the state (which this approach does not eschew, but claims not to privilege), then this statement of values might entrench the problem. Many of the ideas of equality, fairness, and justice that come to mind with the (somewhat rehearsed) use of those words in progressive politics are inseparable from an ethos of enlightenment modernity. This may be problematic on a number of levels. First, </r><u><r class="highlighted">it may </r></u><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">fail to interrupt</r></r><u><r class="highlighted"> the series of choices that</r> </u><r class="font8">Burke suggests </r><u><r class="highlighted">produce</r> <r class="highlighted">a cycle of insecurity</r></u><r class="font8">. Second, it may fold back onto itself in the recommendations that security cosmopolitanism produces. This especially concerned me in Burke’s discussion of how to end ‘dangerous processes,’ where </r><u><r class="highlighted">he places</r> ‘greater <r class="highlighted">faith in</r> the</u><r class="font8"> ethical, normative, and </r><u><r class="highlighted">legal suppression of dangerous processes</r></u><r class="font8"> and actions than in formalistic or procedural solutions’ (p. 24). It seems to me that there is a good argument that ‘</r><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">suppression’ is itself a ‘dangerous process</r></r><r class="font8"><r class="highlighted">,</r></r><u><r class="highlighted">’</r> yet <r class="highlighted">Burke’s framework </r></u><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">does not</r> really <r class="highlighted">include a mechanism for internal critique</r></r><u>. </u><r class="font8">Another problem that seems to confound security cosmopolitanism is evaluating the relationships between power, governance, and governmentality. There are certainly several ways in which Burke uses a notion of the state that distinguishes security cosmopolitanism from the mainstream neoliberal literature. For example, he characterizes the ‘state as an entity whose national survival depends on its global participation, obligations, and depen- dencies,’ (citing Burke 2013a, 5). This view of the state sees it as not only survival-seeking (in the neo-neo synthesis sense) but also dependent on its positive interactions with other states for survival. Burke’s approach to government/governance initially appears to be global rather than state-based, another potentially transformative move. For example, he sees the job of security cosmopolitanism as to ‘theorize and defend norms for the respon- sible conduct and conceptualization of global security governance’ (p. 21). At the same time, later in the article, Burke suggests entrenching the current structure of the state. His practical approach of looking for the ‘solidarity of the governing with the governed’ seems to simultaneously interrogate the current power structures and reify them. Burke says: Such a ‘solidarity of the governed’ that engages in a ‘practical interrogation of power’ ought to be a significant feature of security cosmopolitanism. At the same time, however, security cosmopolitanism must be concerned with improving the global governance of security by elites and experts. (p. 21) </r><u><r class="highlighted">This attachment to the improvement of existing structures</r> of governance <r class="highlighted">seems to be at the heart</r> of what I see as <r class="highlighted">the </r></u><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">failure of the radical potential</r></r><u> in the idea of security cosmopolitanism.</u><r class="font8"> When discussing how the power dynamics between the elite and the subordinated might change, Burke suggests that ‘voluntary renunciation of the privileges and powers of both state and corporate sovereignty will no doubt be a necessary feature of such an order’ (p. 25). </r><u>Relying on the voluntary renunciation of power by the powerful seems both unrealistic and not particularly theoretically innovative. <r class="highlighted">This seems to be</r> at <r class="highlighted">the</r> center of a <r class="highlighted">paradox</r> inherent in security cosmopolitanism: <r class="highlighted">Faith in the</r> Western liberal <r class="highlighted">state is insidious, but the</r> Western liberal <r class="highlighted">state does not have to be.</r></u><r class="font8"><r class="highlighted"> </r></r><u><r class="highlighted">Modernity causes insecurity, but need not be discarded fully</r>.</u><r class="font8"> Some universalizations are dangerous, others are benign. </r><u>Dangerous processes must be stopped, even if by dangerous processes</u><r class="font8">. Moral entrepreneurship is the key, but ther e is no clear foundation for what counts as moral. The security cosmopolitanism critique is inspired by consequentialism, but lacks deontological foundations despite deontological implications. Burke calls for (and indeed demands) to ‘take responsibility for it’ (p. 23) in terms of ‘both formal and moral accountability’ (p. 24). In so doing, he endorses (Booth’s vision of) ‘moral progress’ (p. 25), despite understanding the insidious deployment of various notions of moral progress by others. </r><u><r class="highlighted">Security cosmopolitanism</r></u><r class="font8">, then, </r><u><r class="highlighted">is a proclamation for </r>radical <r class="highlighted">change that is</r></u><r class="font8"> initially </r><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">stalled by its internal contradictions</r></r><r class="font8"><r class="highlighted"> </r></r><u><r class="highlighted">and</r></u><r class="font8"> further </r><u><r class="font8"><s>handicapped</s></r> <r class="highlighted">stalled by its lack of capacity to enact</r> the very sort of radical <r class="highlighted">change</r></u><r class="font8"> Burke sees it as fundamental to righting the wrongs he sees in the world. </r><u><r class="highlighted">The result seems to be the</r></u><r class="font8"> (potential) </r><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">reification of existing</r> governments/<r class="highlighted">governmentality</r></r><u><r class="highlighted"> through</r> what essentially appears to be a</u><r class="font8"> non-anthropocentric ‘</r><u><r class="highlighted">human security’</r> which cannot be clearly distinguished from current notions of human security</u><r class="font8"> (p. 15). </r><u><r class="highlighted">It</r> appears to <r class="highlighted">remain top-down</r> and without clear moral foundation <r class="highlighted">while claiming</r> significant <r class="highlighted">improvement</r> over existing approaches</u><r class="font8">. </r><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">This</r> <r class="highlighted">appearance/</r>seduction <r class="highlighted">of improvement without real promise for change might be </r>more <r class="highlighted">insidious</r> <r class="highlighted">than</r></r><r class="font8"> the </r><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">nihilism</r></r><r class="font8"> of which many post-structuralists are accused, </r><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">as it </r>seductively <r class="highlighted">appears to solve a problem it does not </r>solve.</r></p><br> <br> Card Number: 49<br> <br><h4>complete rejection is critical </h4><p><strong>Neocleous 8</strong> [Mark Neocleous, Prof. of Government @ Brunel, Critique of Security, 185-6]</p><p><u><r class="highlighted">The only way</r></u><r class="font6"><r class="highlighted"> </r>out of such a dilemma, </r><u><r class="highlighted">to escape the <strong>fetish</strong>, is </r>perhaps <r class="highlighted">to </r></u><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">eschew the logic of security </r>altogether</r><u> – to reject it as so ideologically  loaded</u><r class="font6"> in favour of the state </r><u>that any real political thought</u><r class="font6"> other than  the authoritarian and reactionary </r><u>should be pressed to give it up</u><r class="font6">.

Simon Dalby reports a personal communication with Michael Williams, co-editor of the important text Critical Security Studies, in which the latter asks: if you take away security, what do you put in the hole that’s left behind? But I’m inclined to agree with Dalby: maybe there is no hole.142 </r><r class="highlighted"><u>The mistake has been to think that there is a hole</u></r><u> and that this hole needs </u><r class="highlighted"><u>to be ﬁlled with a</u></r><u> new vision or </u><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">revision of security</r></r><r class="highlighted"><u> </u></r><u>in which it is </u><r class="emphasis">re-mapped or civilised</r><u> or gendered or humanised or expanded</u><r class="font6"> or whatever.

Thus while much of what I have said here has been of a negative order, part of the tradition of critical theory is that the negative may be as signiﬁcant as the positive in setting thought on new paths. For if security really is the supreme concept of bourgeois society and the fundamental thematic of liberalism, then to keep harping on about insecurity and </r><u>to </u><r class="font6">keep </r><u>demand</u><r class="font6">ing</r><u>‘more </u><r class="highlighted"><u>security’</u></r><r class="font6"><r class="highlighted"> </r>(while meekly hoping that this increased security doesn’t damage our liberty) </r><r class="highlighted"><u>is </u></r><u>to </u><r class="font8"><s>blind</s></r><strong><u> </u></strong><r class="highlighted"><strong><u>oblivious</u></strong></r><strong><u> ourselves </u></strong><r class="highlighted"><strong><u>to </u></strong></r><strong><u>the possibility of </u></strong><r class="emphasis">building <r class="highlighted">real alternatives</r></r><r class="highlighted"><strong><u> </u></strong></r><strong><u>to the authoritarian tendencies in contemporary politics</u></strong><u>.

Most important, the </r><u>development of the concepts of ‘cognitive dissonance’ versus ‘cognitive consistency’ </u><r class="font8">by Leon Festinger and Fritz Heider in the 1950s and 1960s has </r><u>served to emphasize the need for stability in beliefs</u><r class="font8"> and perceptions, while at the same time alerting us to the costs of such stabilit y: “misperception and biased interpretation, with individuals using denial, bolstering, or other mechanisms to maintain their beliefs.”52 According to Robert Art and Robert Jervis, “[</r><r class="highlighted"><u>P]eople simplify </u></r><u>their </u><r class="highlighted"><u>processing </u></r><u>of complex </u><r class="highlighted"><u>information by permitting </u></r><u>their </u><r class="highlighted"><u>established frameworks</u></r><u> of beliefs </u><r class="highlighted"><u>to guide them</u></r><r class="font8">.

In the 1950s, Kenneth Boulding defined the term image as “the total cognitive, affective, and evaluative structure of the behavioral unit, or its internal view of itself and its universe.”58 He argued that “the images which are important in international systems are those which a nation has of itself and of those other bodies in the system which constitute its international environment.”59 </r><u>Images can introduce misperception and error into the decision-making process, especially if they function as stereotypes</u><r class="font8">. Stereot ypes can be defined as “images that are assumed to have attributes that characterize all elements of a particular group.”60 </r><u>The role of stereotypical images, such as </u><r class="highlighted"><u>the “</u><strong><u>enemy image</u></strong></r><u>,” has been explored</u><r class="font8"> by authors such as Ole Holsti, Richard Cottam, or David Finlay and his colleagues. 61 </r><u>Such studies find that stereot yping generally </u><r class="highlighted"><u>leads to “over-generalization</u></r><u>,</u><r class="font8"> that is, </r><u>erroneously attributing characteristics to a particular countr y</u><r class="font8"> that may not have one or more of the given characteristics. The countries are thus not sufficiently differentiated.”62 According to Holsti, “[</r><u>T]he relationship of national images to international conf lict is clear: decision-makers act upon their definition of the situation and their images of states</u><r class="font8">—others as well as their own</r><u>. These images are in turn dependent upon the decision-maker’s belief system, and these may or may not be accurate representations of ‘reality</u><r class="font8">.’”63 </r><u>The impact of stereot ypical national images in policy making was particularly obvious during the Cold War, when Boulding referred to them as “the last great stronghold of unsophistication” in international politics</u><r class="font8">, observing that “nations are divided into ‘good’ and ‘bad’—the enemy is all bad, one’s own nation is of spotless virtue.”64 </r><u>The bipolar system was commonly characterized as a “closed” one, in which “perceptions of low hostilit y are self-liquidating and perceptions of high hostilit y are self-fulfilling</u><r class="font8">.”65 This is because </r><u>both sides continue to interpret new information in ways that help preserve the enemy image, even if such information is meant to constitute a conciliatory gesture.</u><r class="font8"> Closed systems suffer from the dangerous problem of distorted “mirror images.” Urie Bronfenbrenner explains: </r><u>Herein lies the terrible danger of the </u><r class="highlighted"><u>distorted mirror image</u></r><u>, for it is characteristic of such images that they </u><r class="highlighted"><u>are self-confirming;</u></r><u> that is, each part y, often against its own wishes, is increasingly driven to behave in a manner which fulfills the expectations of the other. . . . [The mirror image] impels each nation to act in a manner which confirms and enhances the fear of the other to the point that even deliberate efforts to reverse the process are reinterpreted as evidence of confirmation.</u><r class="font8">66 (128-130)</r></p><br> <br> Card Number: 51<br> <br><h4><a id="_Hlk527538099"></a>Performative contradiction isn’t a unique voter – it allows us to prevent a sedimentation of knowledge – constant fear of it causes people to not write what is important but what doesn’t contradict</h4><p>Pierre <strong>Schlag</strong>, April 19<strong>91</strong>, “<em>SYMPOSIUM: THE CRITIQUE OF NORMATIVITY: ARTICLE: NORMATIVITY AND THE POLITICS OF FORM</em>,” University of Pennsylvania Law Review, accessed through Nexus-Uni.

Although some commentators may judge that the road to the existing situation is paved with good intentions, a truly strategic approach to the problem of international terrorism requires a more sensitive consideration of the medium-to-long-term implications of state building in different parts of the world whilst also addressing the root causes of the problem of state 'failure'.  Developing this line of argument further, reflection on different socially relevant meanings of 'state failure' in relation to different time increments shaping policymaking might convey alternative considerations. In line with John Ruggie (1998, pp. 167–170), divergent issues might then come to the fore when viewed through the different lenses of particular time increments. Firstly, </r>viewed through the lenses of an incremental time frame, more immediate concerns to policymakers usually become apparent when linked to precocious assumptions about terrorist networks, banditry and the breakdown of social order within failed states.<r class="font8"> Hence relevant players and events are readily identified (al-Qa'eda), their attributes assessed (axis of evil, 'strong'/'weak' states) and judgements made about their long-term significance (war on terrorism). </r>The key analytical problem for policymaking in this narrow and blinkered domain is the one of choice given the <r class="highlighted">constraints of time and energy</r> devoted to a particular decision<r class="font8">. </r>These factors <r class="highlighted">lead policymakers to </r></u><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">bring conceptual baggage to bear</r></r><u><r class="font8"> on an issue </r><r class="highlighted">that</r><r class="font8"> simplifies but also </r><r class="highlighted">distorts information</r><r class="font8">.  </r>Taking a second temporal form<r class="font8">, that of a conjunctural time frame, </r>policy <r class="highlighted">responses are subject to more fundamental epistemological concerns</r><r class="font8">. Factors assumed to be constant within an incremental time frame are more variable and it is more difficult to produce an intended effect on ongoing processes than it is on actors and discrete events. For instance, how long should the 'war on terror' be waged for? Areas of policy in this realm can therefore begin to become more concerned with the underlying forces that shape current trajectories.  </r>Shifting attention to a third temporal form draws attention to still different dimensions<r class="font8">. Within an epochal time frame an agenda still in the making appears that requires a shift in decision-making, away from a conventional problem-solving mode 'wherein doing nothing is favoured on burden-of-proof grounds', towards a risk-averting mode, characterised by prudent contingency measures. To conclude, in relation to 'failed states', the latter time frame entails reflecting on the very structural conditions shaping the problems of 'failure' raised throughout the present discussion, which will demand lasting and delicate attention frompractitioners across the academy and policymaking communities alike. </r></u></p><br> <br> Card Number: 53<br> <br><h4>Permutation do the AFF and challenge the national security paradigm---<u>methodologically pluralist</u> understandings are more predictive.</h4><p>Roland <strong>Bleiker 14</strong>, Professor of International Relations, University of Queensland, “International Theory Between Reification and Self-Reflective Critique,” International Studies Review, 16(2), 6-17-2014, p.325-327</p><p><r class="font7">This book is part of an increasing trend of scholarly works that have embraced poststructural critique but want to ground it in more positive political foundations, while retaining a reluctance to return to the positivist tendencies that implicitly underpin much of constructivist research. The path that Daniel Levine has carved out is innovative, sophisticated, and convincing. A superb scholarly achievement. For Levine, </r><u><r class="highlighted">the key challenge in</r></u><r class="font7"> international relations (</r><u><r class="highlighted">IR</r></u><r class="font7">) </r><u>scholarship <r class="highlighted">is</r></u><r class="font7"> what he calls </r><u>“unchecked reification”: the widespread and dangerous process of </u><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">forgetting “the distinction between </r>theoretical <r class="highlighted">concepts and the </r>real-world <r class="highlighted">things they </r>mean to <r class="highlighted">describe</r></r><r class="font7"> or to which they refer” (p. 15). </r><u>The </u><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">dangers are real</r></r><r class="font7">, Levine stresses, </r><u>because </u><r class="emphasis">IR deals with</r><u> some of the most difficult issues, <r class="highlighted">from </r></u><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">genocides</r></r><u><r class="highlighted"> to </r></u><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">war</r></r><r class="font7">. </r><u><r class="highlighted">Upholding one subjective position without critical scrutiny can</r></u><r class="font7"> thus </r><u><r class="highlighted">have </r></u><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">far-reaching consequences</r></r><r class="font7">. Following Theodor Adorno—who is the key theoretical influence on this book—Levine takes a post-positive position and assumes that the world cannot be known outside of our human perceptions and the values that are inevitably intertwined with them. His ultimate goal is to overcome reification, or, to be more precise, to recognize it as an inevitable aspect of thought so that its dangerous consequences can be mitigated. </r><u>Levine</u><r class="font7"> proceeds in three stages: First he reviews several decades of IR theories to resurrect critical moments when scholars displayed an acute awareness of the dangers of reification. He refreshingly breaks down distinctions between conventional and progressive scholarship, for he </r><u>detects self-reflective and critical moments in</u><r class="font7"> scholars that are usually associated with </r><u>straightforward positivist positions</u><r class="font7"> (such as E.H. Carr, Hans Morgenthau, or Graham Allison). But Levine also shows how these moments of self-reflexivity never lasted long and were driven out by the compulsion to offer systematic and scientific knowledge. The second stage of Levine's inquiry </r><u>outlines why</u><r class="font7"> IR scholars regularly closed down critique. Here, he points to a range of factors and phenomena, from peer review processes to the speed at which academics are meant to publish. And here too, he eschews conventional wisdom, showing that work conducted in the wake of the third debate, </r><u>while explicitly </u><r class="emphasis">post-positivist</r><r class="font7"> and critiquing the reifying tendencies of existing </r><r class="emphasis">IR scholarship</r><u>, often </u><r class="emphasis">lacked critical self-awareness</r><r class="font7">. As a result, Levine believes that many of the </r><u>respective authors failed to appreciate sufficiently that “reification is a consequence of all thinking—including itself”</u><r class="font7"> (p. 68). The third objective of Levine's book is also the most interesting one. Here, he outlines the path toward what he calls “</r><u>sustainable </u><r class="emphasis">critique</r><r class="font7">”: a form of self-reflection that can counter the dangers of reification. Critique, for him, </r><u>is </u><r class="emphasis">not just</r><u> something that is </u><r class="emphasis">directed outwards</r><u>, against particular theories or theorists</u><r class="font7">. </r><u>It is </u><r class="emphasis">also inward</r><u>-oriented, ongoing, and sensitive to the “limitations of thought itself”</u><r class="font7"> (p. 12). The challenges that such a sustainable critique faces are formidable. Two stand out: First, if the natural tendency to forget the origins and values of our concepts are as strong as Levine and other Adorno-inspired theorists believe they are, then how can we actually recognize our own reifying tendencies? Are we not all inevitably and subconsciously caught in a web of meanings from which we cannot escape? Second, if one constantly questions one's own perspective, does one not fall into a relativism that loses the ability to establish the kind of stable foundations that are necessary for political action? Adorno has, of course, been critiqued as relentlessly negative, even by his second-generation Frankfurt School successors (from Jürgen Habermas to his IR interpreters, such as Andrew Linklater and Ken Booth). The response that Levine has to these two sets of legitimate criticisms are, in my view, both convincing and useful at a practical level. </r><u>He starts off with depicting reification not as a flaw that is meant to be expunged, but as an a priori condition for scholarship</u><r class="font7">. The challenge then is not to let it go unchecked. </r><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">Methodological pluralism</r></r><u> lies at the heart of</u> Levine's <u>sustainable critique</u><r class="font7">.

For example,  when Ashley makes surmises about the future of realism, he claims that "a crucial issue  is whether or not changing historical conditions have disabled longstanding realist  rituals of power." Specifically, he asks whether "developments in late capitalist society;"  like the "fiscal crisis of the state," and the "internationalization of capital," coupled with  "the presence of vastly destructive and highly automated nuclear arsenals [has] de-  prived statesmen of the latitude for competent performance of realist rituals of  power?"  157 Similarly<r class="font6">, </r><r class="font12"><u>Cox argues</u></r><r class="font6"> that </r><r class="font12"><u>fundamental </u></r><u><r class="font12"><r class="highlighted">change occurs when there is a  "disjuncture" between "the stock of ideas people have about the nature of the world  and the practical problems that challenge them</r></r></u><r class="font6">." He then writes, "Some of us think the  erstwhile dominant mental construct of neorealism is inadequate to confront the chal-  lenges of global politics today."158  It would be understandable if realists made such arguments, since they believe there  is an objective reality that largely determines which discourse will be dominant. Critical  theorists, however, emphasize that the world is socially constructed, and not shaped in  fundamental ways by objective factors. Anarchy, after all, is what we make of it. Yet  </r><u><r class="font12">when critical theorists</r></u><r class="font12"><u> attempt to </u></r><u><r class="font12">explain why realism may be losing its hegemonic  position, they too point to objective factors</r></u><r class="font12"><u> as the ultimate cause of change. </u></r><u><r class="font12"><r class="highlighted">Discourse</r>,</r></u><r class="font12"><u>  so it appears, </u></r><u><r class="font12"><r class="highlighted">turns out not to be determinative, but</r> </r></u><r class="font6">mainly</r><u><r class="font12"> <r class="highlighted">a</r> <r class="highlighted">reflection of developments  in the objective world</r></r></u><r class="font12"><r class="highlighted"><u>.</u></r><u> In short, it seems that when critical theorists who study inter-  national politics offer glimpses of their thinking about the causes of change in the real  world, they make arguments that directly contradict their own theory, but which appear  to be compatible with the theory they are challenging.</u></r><r class="font6">159  </r>There is another problem with the application of critical theory to international  relations. Although critical theorists hope to replace realism with a discourse that  emphasizes harmony and peace, critical theory per se emphasizes that it is impossible  to know the future. Critical theory, according to its own logic, can be used to undermine  realism and produce change, but it cannot serve as the basis for predicting which  discourse will replace realism, because the theory says little about the direction change  takes. In fact, Cox argues that although "utopian expectations may be an element in  stimulating people to act ... such expectations are almost never realized in practice."  </p><br> <br> Card Number: 61<br> <br><h4><a id="_Hlk84209"></a>Extinction outweighs</h4><p>Seth D. <strong>Baum &amp;</strong> Anthony M. <strong>Barrett 18</strong>.

What Is GCR And Why Is It Important? <u>Taken </u><r class="emphasis">literally</r><u>, a global catastrophe can be any event that is in some way catastrophic across the globe</u>. <u>This suggests a rather low threshold</u> for what counts as a global catastrophe. An event causing just one death on each continent (say, from a jet-setting assassin) could rate as a global catastrophe, because surely these deaths would be catastrophic for the deceased and their loved ones. <u>However, in common usage, a global catastrophe would be </u><r class="emphasis">catastrophic</r><u> for a significant portion of the globe</u>. Minimum thresholds have variously been set around ten thousand to ten million deaths or $10 billion to $10 trillion in damages (Bostrom and Ćirković 2008), or death of one quarter of the human population (Atkinson 1999; Hempsell 2004). <u>Others have emphasized catastrophes that cause </u><r class="emphasis">long-term declines in the trajectory of human civilization</r> (Beckstead 2013), <u>that human civilization </u><r class="emphasis">does not recover from</r> (Maher and Baum 2013), <u>that drastically reduce humanity’s potential for future achievements</u> (<u>Bostrom</u> 2002, <u>using the term “</u><r class="emphasis">existential risk</r><u>”), or that result in </u><r class="emphasis">human extinction</r> (Matheny 2007; Posner 2004). <u>A common theme across all these treatments of GCR is that </u><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">some</r> <r class="highlighted">catastrophes</r> <r class="highlighted">are vastly more important than others</r></r>. Carl Sagan was perhaps the first to recognize this, in his commentary on nuclear winter (Sagan 1983). <u>Without nuclear winter, a global nuclear war might kill several hundred million people. This is obviously a major catastrophe, but humanity would presumably carry on. However, with </u><r class="emphasis">nuclear winter</r>, per Sagan, <r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">humanity</r> <r class="highlighted">could go extinct</r></r><u>. The loss would be not just an additional four billion or so deaths, but the <r class="highlighted">loss of </r></u><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">all future generations</r></r><r class="highlighted">.</r> To paraphrase Sagan, <u>the loss would be billions and billions of lives, or even </u><r class="emphasis">more</r>. <u>Sagan estimated </u><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">500 trillion lives</r></r><u>, assuming humanity would continue for ten million more years, which he cited as typical for a successful species. Sagan’s 500 trillion number <r class="highlighted">may</r> even <r class="highlighted">be an </r></u><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">underestimate</r></r>. The analysis here takes an adventurous turn, hinging on the evolution of the human species and the long-term fate of the universe. On these long time scales, the descendants of contemporary humans may no longer be recognizably “human”. The issue then is whether the descendants are still worth caring about, whatever they are. If they are, then it begs the question of how many of them there will be. Barring major global catastrophe, Earth will remain habitable for about one billion more years 2 until the Sun gets too warm and large. The rest of the Solar System, Milky Way galaxy, universe, and (if it exists) the multiverse will remain habitable for a lot longer than that (Adams and Laughlin 1997), should our descendants gain the capacity to migrate there. <u>An open question in astronomy is whether it is possible for the descendants of humanity to continue living for an </u><r class="emphasis">infinite length of time</r><u> or instead merely an </u><r class="emphasis">astronomically large but finite</r><u> length of time</u> (see e.g. Ćirković 2002; Kaku 2005). Either way,<u> the stakes with global catastrophes </u><r class="emphasis">could</r><u> be </u><r class="emphasis">much larger than the loss of 500 trillion lives. </r><u>Debates about the infinite vs. the merely astronomical are of theoretical interest</u> (Ng 1991; Bossert et al. 2007), <u>but they have </u><r class="emphasis">limited practical significance</r><u>. This can be seen when </u><r class="emphasis">evaluating GCRs from a standard <r class="highlighted">risk-equals-probability-times-magnitude</r> framework</r><u>. Using Sagan’s 500 trillion lives estimate, it follows that reducing the probability of global catastrophe by a mere one-in-500-trillion chance is of the same significance as saving one human life. Phrased differently, <r class="highlighted">society should </r></u><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">try 500 trillion times harder to prevent</r> a <r class="highlighted">global catastrophe</r> <r class="highlighted">than</r> it should <r class="highlighted">to save a person’s life</r></r><u>. Or, preventing one million deaths is equivalent to a one-in500-million reduction in the probability of global catastrophe. This suggests society should </u><r class="emphasis">make extremely large investment in GCR reduction, at the expense of virtually all other objectives. </r>Judge and legal scholar Richard Posner made a similar point in monetary terms (Posner 2004). Posner used $50,000 as the value of a statistical human life (VSL) and 12 billion humans as the total loss of life (double the 2004 world population); he describes both figures as significant underestimates. Multiplying them gives $600 trillion as an underestimate of the value of preventing global catastrophe. For comparison, the United States government typically uses a VSL of around one to ten million dollars (Robinson 2007). Multiplying a $10 million VSL with 500 trillion lives gives $5x1021 as the value of preventing global catastrophe. But even using “just" $600 trillion, <u>society should be willing to spend</u> at least that much to prevent a global catastrophe, which converts to being willing to spend at least <u>$1 million for a one-in-500-million reduction in the probability of global catastrophe</u>. Thus <u>while reasonable disagreement exists on how large of a VSL to use and how much to count future generations, even low-end positions suggest </u><r class="emphasis">vast resource allocations</r><u> should be redirected to reducing GCR. This conclusion is only </u><r class="emphasis">strengthened</r><u> when considering the </u><r class="emphasis">astronomical size of the stakes</r>, but the same point holds either way. The bottom line is that, <u>as long as something along the lines of the standard riskequals-probability-times-magnitude framework is being used, then </u><r class="emphasis">even tiny GCR reductions</r><u> merit significant effort. This point holds especially strongly for risks of catastrophes that would cause </u><r class="emphasis">permanent harm to global human civilization</r><u>. The discussion thus far has assumed that all human lives are valued equally. This assumption is </u><r class="emphasis">not universally held</r>. <u>People often value some people more than others</u>, favoring themselves, their family and friends, their compatriots, their generation, or others whom they identify with. <u>Great debates rage on across moral philosophy, economics, and other fields about how much people should value others</u> who are distant in space, time, or social relation, as well as the unborn members of future generations. <u>This debate is crucial</u> for all valuations of risk, including GCR. Indeed, if each of us only cares about our immediate selves, then global catastrophes may not be especially important, and we probably have better things to do with our time than worry about them. <u><r class="highlighted">While everyone has the right to their </r></u><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">own views</r> and feelings</r>, we find that <u><r class="highlighted">the strongest arguments are for the </r></u><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">widely held position</r></r><u><r class="highlighted"> that </r></u><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">all human lives should be valued equally</r></r><u>.</u> This position is succinctly stated in the United States Declaration of Independence, updated in the 1848 Declaration of Sentiments: “We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men and 3 women are created equal”. <u><r class="highlighted">Philosophers speak of a</r>n agent-neutral, objective “view from nowhere”</u> (Nagel 1986) <u>or <r class="highlighted">a “veil of ignorance”</r></u> (Rawls 1971) <u><r class="highlighted">in which each</r> person <r class="highlighted">considers what is best for society </r></u><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">irrespective of which member</r> of society <r class="highlighted">they happen to be</r></r>. <u>Such a perspective </u><r class="emphasis">suggests <r class="highlighted">valuing everyone equally</r></r><u>, regardless of who they are or where or when they live.

Secondly, that </r><u>even this does not make us masters of our own destiny. We can make visionary choices, but the future can still surprise us. </u><r class="font6">This is a humbling realization.

I am an optimist. From my bubble of privilege, life feels like a rollercoaster ride full of ever more impressive wonders, even as I try to fight the many social injustices that still blight us. However, the accelerating pace of change amid uncertainty elicits one fundamental observation. </r><u>Among the infinite future possibilities</u><r class="emphasis">, <r class="highlighted">only one outcome is truly irreversible: extinction</r></r><r class="font6"><r class="highlighted">. </r></r><u><r class="highlighted">Concerns</r></u><r class="font6"> about extinction </r><u><r class="highlighted">are</r></u><r class="font6"> often </r><u><r class="highlighted">dismissed</r> as </u><r class="emphasis">apocalyptic alarmism</r><r class="font6">.

They wiped each other out, or coalesced into larger formations following the agricultural revolution. However, as major civilizations emerged, even those that reached incredible heights, such as the Egyptians and the Romans, eventually collapsed. </r><u>It is only in the very recent past that we became a truly global civilization</u><r class="font6">. Our interconnectedness continues to grow rapidly. “Stand or fall, we are the last civilization”, as Ricken Patel, the founder of the global civic movement Avaaz, put it. 2. Environmental pressures can drive extinction More than </r><u>15,000 scientists just issued a ‘warning to humanity’</u><r class="font6">. They called on us to reduce our impact on the biosphere, 25 years after their first such appeal. The warning notes that we are far outstripping the capacity of our planet in all but one measure of ozone depletion, including emissions, biodiversity, freshwater availability and more. The scientists, not a crowd known to overstate facts, conclude: “soon it will be too late to shift course away from our failing trajectory, and time is running out”. In his 2005 book Collapse, Jared </r><u>Diamond charts the history of past societies</u><r class="font6">. He makes the case that </r><u>overpopulation and resource use beyond the carrying capacity have often been important, </u><r class="font6">if not the only, drivers </r><u>of collapse. </u><r class="font6">Even though we are making important incremental progress in battles such as climate change, </r><u>we must</u><r class="font6"> still </r><u>achieve tremendous </u><r class="font6">step </r><u>changes in our response to several major environmental crises.</u><r class="font6"> We must do this even while the world’s population continues to grow. These pressures are bound to exert great stress on our global civilization. 3. Superintelligence: unplanned obsolescence? Imagine a monkey society that foresaw the ascendance of humans. Fearing a loss of status and power, it decided to kill the proverbial Adam and Eve. It crafted the most ingenious plan it could: starve the humans by taking away all their bananas. Foolproof plan, right? This story describes the fundamental difficulty with superintelligence. A superintelligent being may always do something entirely different from what we, with our mere mortal intelligence, can foresee. In his 2014 book Superintelligence, Swedish philosopher Nick Bostrom presents the challenge in thought-provoking detail, and advises caution. </r><r class="emphasis">Bostrom cites a survey of industry experts that projected a 50% chance of the development of artificial superintelligence by 2050</r><r class="font6">, </r><r class="emphasis">and a 90% chance by 2075</r><r class="font6">. The latter date is within the life expectancy of many alive today. </r><u>Visionaries</u><r class="font6"> like Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk have </r><u>warned of the existential risks from artificial superintelligence. </u><r class="font6">Their opposite camp includes Larry Page and Mark Zuckerberg. But on an issue that concerns the future of humanity, is it really wise to ignore the guy who explained the nature of space to us and another guy who just put a reusable rocket in it? 4. Technology: known knowns and unknown unknowns Many fundamentally disruptive technologies are coming of age, from bioengineering to quantum computing, 3-D printing, robotics, nanotechnology and more. Lord Martin Rees describes potential existential challenges from some of these technologies, such as a bioengineered pandemic, in his book Our Final Century. Imagine if North Korea, feeling secure in its isolation, could release a virulent strain of Ebola, engineered to be airborne. Would it do it? Would ISIS? Projecting decades forward, we will likely develop capabilities that are unthinkable even now. The unknown unknowns of our technological path are profoundly humbling. 5. 'The Trump Factor' Despite our scientific ingenuity, we are still a confused and confusing species. Think back to two years ago, and how you thought the world worked then. Has that not been upended by the election of Donald Trump as US President, and everything that has happened since? The mix of billions of messy humans will forever be unpredictable. When the combustible forces described above are added to this melee, we find ourselves on a tightrope.

One would be hard pressed to find in realist theorizations anything resembling a supple understanding of race and racism (Vitalis 2015)— though Carr (2001b, 107) demonstrates a comparatively great deal of reflexivity on postcolonial liberation (see fn. 2 above). Even in Williams’s (2005) “wilful” realist tradition, there is scant discussion of how an embedded ethic of critical self-limitation fared in the context of racial or other forms of radical difference. Absent an engagement with the analytics of postcolonial thinking, or the diverse ways in which white supremacy, patriarchy, and heteronormativity inflect past and present liberal imperial formations, willful realism does not address the categories that threaten to push prudential skeptics toward violent responses, that pose limitations to an ethos of limits.

The reason behind this qualification is not hard to understand. With great trepidation my contention is that <strong><u>one of the main distinctions we need to take into account while examining securitization is that between 'institutional' and 'brute' threats. In its attempts to follow a</u></strong> more <strong><u>radical approach to security problems where</u></strong>in <strong><u>threats are</u></strong> institutional, that is, <strong><u>mere products of communicative relations</u></strong> between agents, the <strong><u>CS has neglected the importance of 'external</u></strong> or brute threats', that is, <r class="highlighted"><strong><u>threats </u></strong></r><strong><u>that </u></strong><r class="highlighted"><strong><u>do not depend on language mediation to be what they are</u></strong></r>- <strong><u>hazards for human life.

Indeed, securitization, as suggested earlier, is successful when the securitizing agent and the audience reach a common structured perception of an ominous development. In this scheme, there is no security problem except through the language game. Therefore, <strong><u>how problems are 'out there' is exclusively contingent upon how we linguistically depict them.</u></strong> This <strong><u>is not always true</u></strong>. For one, <r class="highlighted"><strong><u>language </u></strong></r><r class="font14"><r class="highlighted"><strong><u>does not construct</u></strong></r></r><r class="highlighted"><strong><u> reality</u></strong></r><strong><u>; at best, it shapes our perception of it</u></strong>.

Walsh School of Foreign Service and the Department of Government at Georgetown University, “What's Empire Got to Do with It? The Derivation of America's Foreign Policy,” Critical Review: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Politics and Society 21.1, 21-75)</p><p><r class="font5">Rummaging through the concomitants of “imperialism,” Eland (2004, 65) discovers the thesis of </r><u><r class="highlighted">“threat inflation”</r></u><r class="font5"> (in this case, virtual threat invention): Obviously, much higher spending for the military, homeland security, and foreign aid are required for a policy of global intervention than for a policy of merely defending the republic. For example, after the cold war, the security bureaucracies began looking for new enemies to justify keeping defense and intelligence budgets high. Similarly, Eland (ibid., 183), in a section entitled “Imperial Wars Spike Corporate Welfare,” attributes a large portion of the U.S. defense budget—particularly the procurement of major weapons systems, such as “Virginia‐class submarines … aircraft carriers … F‐22 fighters … [and] Osprey tilt‐rotor transport aircraft”—not to the systemically derived requirement for certain kinds of military capabilities, but, rather, to the imperatives of corporate pork. He opines that such weapons have no strategic or operational justification; that “the American empire, militarily more dominant than any empire in world history, can fight brushfire wars against terrorists and their ‘rogue’ state sponsors without those gold‐plated white elephants.” The underlying notion of “the security bureaucracies … looking for new enemies” </r><u><r class="highlighted">is</r> a <r class="highlighted">threadbare</r> concept that has somehow taken hold across the political spectrum</u><r class="font5">, from the radical left (viz. Michael Klare [1981], who refers to a “threat bank”), to the liberal center (viz. Robert H. Johnson [1997], who dismisses most alleged “threats” as “improbable dangers”), to libertarians (viz. Ted Galen Carpenter [1992], Vice President for Foreign and Defense Policy of the Cato Institute, who wrote a book entitled A Search for Enemies). </r><u><r class="highlighted">What is missing</r> from most analysts’ claims of “threat inflation,” however, <r class="highlighted">is a</r> convincing theory of <r class="highlighted">why</r></u><r class="font5">, say, the American government significantly (not merely in excusable rhetoric) might magnify and even invent threats (and, more seriously, act on such inflated threat estimates). In a few places, </r><u>Eland</u><r class="font5"> (2004, 185) </r><u>suggests that such behavior might stem from military or national security bureaucrats’ attempts to enhance their personal status and organizational budgets</u><r class="font5">, or even from the influence and dominance of “the military‐industrial complex”; viz.: “Maintaining the empire and retaliating for the blowback from that empire keeps what President Eisenhower called the military‐industrial complex fat and happy.” Or, in the same section: In the nation’s capital, </r><u>vested interests</u><r class="font5">, such as the law enforcement bureaucracies … </r><u>routinely take advantage of “crises”</u><r class="font5">to satisfy parochial desires. Similarly, many corporations use crises to get pet projects— a.k.a. pork—funded by the government. And national security crises, because of people’s fears, are especially ripe opportunities to grab largesse. (Ibid., 182) Thus, “bureaucratic‐politics” theory, which once made several reputations (such as those of Richard Neustadt, Morton Halperin, and Graham Allison) in defense‐intellectual circles, and spawned an entire sub‐industry within the field of international relations, 5 is put into the service of dismissing putative security threats as imaginary. So, too, can a surprisingly cognate theory, “public choice,” 6 which can be considered the right‐wing analog of the “bureaucratic‐politics” model, and is a preferred interpretation of governmental decision‐making among libertarian observers. As Eland (2004, 203) summarizes: </r><u>Public‐choice theory argues</u><r class="font5"> [that] </r><u>the government</u><r class="font5"> itself </r><u>can develop separate interests from its citizens</u><r class="font5">. The government reflects the interests of powerful pressure groups and the interests of the bureaucracies and the bureaucrats in them. Although this problem occurs in both foreign and domestic policy, it may be more severe in foreign policy because citizens pay less attention to policies that affect them less directly. There is, in this statement of public‐choice theory, a certain ambiguity, and a certain degree of contradiction: </r><u>Bureaucrats are supposedly, at the same time, subservient</u><r class="font5"> to societal interest groups </r><u>and autonomous</u><r class="font5"> from society in general. This journal has pioneered the argument that state autonomy is a likely consequence of the public’s ignorance of most areas of state activity (e.g., Somin 1998; DeCanio 2000a, 2000b, 2006, 2007; Ravenal 2000a). But state autonomy does not necessarily mean that bureaucrats substitute their own interests for those of what could be called the “national society” that they ostensibly serve. I have argued (Ravenal 2000a) that, precisely because of the public‐ignorance and elite‐expertise factors, and especially because the opportunities—at least for bureaucrats (a few notable post‐government lobbyist cases nonwithstanding)—for lucrative self‐dealing are stringently fewer in the defense and diplomatic areas of government than they are in some of the contract‐dispensing and more under‐the‐radar‐screen agencies of government, the “public‐choice” imputation of self‐dealing, rather than working toward the national interest (which, however may not be synonymous with the interests, perceived or expressed, of citizens!) is less likely to hold. In short, state autonomy is likely to mean, in the derivation of foreign policy, that “state elites” are using rational judgment, in insulation from self‐promoting interest groups—about what strategies, forces, and weapons are required for national defense. Ironically, “public choice”—not even a species of economics, but rather a kind of political interpretation—is not even about “public” choice, since, like the bureaucratic‐politics model, it repudiates the very notion that bureaucrats make truly “public” choices; rather, they are held, axiomatically, to exhibit “rent‐seeking” behavior, wherein they abuse their public positions in order to amass private gains, or at least to build personal empires within their ostensibly official niches. Such sub‐rational models actually explain very little of what they purport to observe. Of course, there is some truth in them, regarding the “behavior” of some people, at some times, in some circumstances, under some conditions of incentive and motivation. But the factors that they posit operate mostly as constraints on the otherwise rational optimization of objectives that, if for no other reason than the playing out of official roles, transcends merely personal or parochial imperatives. My treatment of “role” differs from that of the bureaucratic‐politics theorists, whose model of the derivation of foreign policy depends heavily, and acknowledgedly, on a narrow and specific identification of the role‐playing of organizationally situated individuals in a partly conflictual “pulling and hauling” process that “results in” some policy outcome. Even here, bureaucratic‐politics theorists Graham Allison and Philip Zelikow (1999, 311) allow that “some players are not able to articulate [sic] the governmental politics game because their conception of their job does not legitimate such activity.” This is a crucial admission, and one that points—empirically—to the need for a broader and generic treatment of role. </r><u>Roles</u><r class="font5"> (all theorists state) </r><u>give rise to “expectations” of performance. My point is that <r class="highlighted">virtually every</r> governmental role, and especially <r class="highlighted">national‐security roles</r>, and particularly</u><r class="font5"> the roles of </r><u>the</u><r class="font5"> uniformed </r><u>military</u><r class="font5">, </r><u><r class="highlighted">embody</r> expectations of <r class="highlighted">devotion to the “national interest”</r></u><r class="font5">; </r><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">rationality</r></r><u> in the derivation of policy</u><r class="font5"> at every functional level; </r><u><r class="highlighted">and </r></u><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">objectivity</r></r><u> in the treatment of parameters</u><r class="font5">, especially external parameters </r><u>such as “threats”</u><r class="font5"> and the power and capabilities of other nations. </r><u>Sub‐rational models</u><r class="font5"> (such as “public choice”) </r><u>fail to take into account even a partial dedication to the “national” interest</u><r class="font5"> (or even the possibility that the national interest may be honestly misconceived in more parochial terms). </r><u>In contrast, an official’s role connects the individual to the</u><r class="font5"> (state‐level) </r><u>process, and moderates the</u><r class="font5"> (perhaps otherwise) </r><u>self‐seeking impulses of the individual</u><r class="font5">. </r><u><r class="highlighted">Role‐derived behavior tends to be </r></u><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">formalized and codified</r></r><r class="font5">; relatively </r><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">transparent</r></r><u><r class="highlighted"> and</r></u><r class="font5"> at least </r><r class="emphasis"><r class="highlighted">peer‐reviewed</r></r><r class="font5">, so as to be consistent with expectations; </r><u>surviving the particular individual and transmitted to successors and ancillaries</u><r class="font5">; </r><u>measured against a standard</u><r class="font5"> and thus corrigible; </r><u>defined in terms of</u><r class="font5"> the performed </r><u>function</u><r class="font5"> and therefore derived from the state function; </r><u>and uncorrrupt, because</u><r class="font5"> personal </r><u>cheating and</u><r class="font5"> even egregious </r><u>aggrandizement are conspicuously discouraged</u><r class="font5">.

Radical critics of contemporary security policies, such as human security and humanitarian intervention, argue that we see an assertion of Western power and the creation of liberal subjectivities in the developing world. For example, see Mark Duffield’s important and insightful contribution to the ongoing debates about contemporary international security and development. Duffield attempts to provide a coherent empirical engagement with, and theoretical explanation of, these shifts. Whilst these shifts, away from a focus on state security, and the so-called merging of security and development are often portrayed as positive and progressive shifts that have come about because of the end of the Cold War, Duffield argues convincingly that these shifts are highly problematic and unprogressive. For example, the rejection of sovereignty as formal international equality and a presumption of nonintervention has eroded the division between the international and domestic spheres and led to an international environment in which Western NGOs and powerful states have a major role in the governance of third world states. Whilst for supporters of humanitarian intervention this is a good development, Duffield points out the depoliticising implications, drawing on examples in Mozambique and Afghanistan.  Duffield also draws out the problems of the retreat from modernisation that is represented by sustainable development. The Western world has moved away from the development policies of the Cold War, which aimed to develop third world states industrially. Duffield describes this in terms of a new division of human life into uninsured and insured life. Whilst we in the West are ‘insured’ – that is we no longer have to be entirely self-reliant, we have welfare systems, a modern division of labour and so on – sustainable development aims to teach populations in poor states how to survive in the absence of any of this. </r><u>Third world populations must be taught to be self-reliant, they will remain uninsured. Self-reliance of course means the condemnation of millions to a barbarous life of inhuman bare survival</u><r class="font5">. Ironically, although sustainable development is celebrated by many on the left today, by leaving people to fend for themselves rather than developing a society wide system which can support people, sustainable development actually leads to a less human and humane system than that developed in modern capitalist states. Duffield also describes how many of these problematic shifts are embodied in the contemporary concept of human security.  For Duffield, we can understand these shifts in terms of Foucauldian biopolitical framework, which can be understood as a regulatory power that seeks to support life through intervening in the biological, social and economic processes that constitute a human population (2007: 16). Sustainable development and human security are for Duffield technologies of security which aim to create self-managing and self-reliant subjectivities in the third world, which can then survive in a situation of serious underdevelopment (or being uninsured as Duffield terms it) without  causing security problems for the developed world. For Duffield this is all driven by a neoliberal project which seeks to control and manage uninsured populations globally. Radical critic Costas Douzinas (2007) also criticises new forms of cosmopolitanism such as human rights and interventions for human rights as a triumph of American hegemony.

This does not change the fact that through practice agents are continuously producing and reproducing identities and interests, continuously “choosing now the preferences [they] will have later.” But it does mean that choices may not be experienced with meaningful degrees of freedom. <u>This could be a constructivist justification for the realist position that only simple learning is possible in self-help systems.</u> <u>The realist might concede that such <r class="highlighted">systems are </r>socially <r class="highlighted">constructed </r>and <r class="highlighted">still</r> argue that after the corresponding identities and in have become institutionalized, <r class="highlighted">they are</r> almost</u> <u><r class="highlighted">impossible to transform</r>.</u></p><br> <br> Card Number: 71<br> <br><h4>Threats are real – we must securitize them to prevent war  </h4><p><r class="font12"><strong>Knudsen 1</strong></r><r class="font9">– PoliSci Professor at Sodertorn (Olav, Post-Copenhagen Security Studies, Security Dialogue 32:3)</r></p><p><r class="font7">Moreover, I have a problem with the underlying implication that it is unimportant whether states 'really' face dangers from other states or groups. In the Copenhagen school, threats are seen as coming mainly from the actors' own fears, or from what happens when the fears of individuals turn into paranoid political action</r><u>. In my view, this emphasis on the subjective is <r class="highlighted">a misleading conception of threat</r>, in that it <r class="highlighted">discounts </r>an independent <r class="highlighted">existence for</r> what- ever is perceived as <r class="highlighted">a threat</r>. Granted, political life is often marked by <r class="highlighted">misperceptions</r>, mistakes, pure imaginations, ghosts, or mirages, but such phenomena <r class="highlighted">do not occur simultaneously to large numbers of politicians, and hardly most of the time</r>. During the Cold War, <r class="highlighted">threats </r>- in the sense of plausible possibilities of danger - referred to 'real' phenomena, and they <r class="highlighted">refer to 'real' phenomena </r>now</u><r class="font7">. The objects referred to are often not the same, but that is a different matter. Threats have to be dealt with both ín terms of perceptions and in terms of the phenomena which are perceived to be threatening. The point of Waever’s concept of security is not the potential existence of danger somewhere but the use of the word itself by political elites. In his 1997 PhD dissertation, he writes, ’One can View “security” as that which is in language theory called a speech act: it is not interesting as a sign referring to something more real - it is the utterance itself that is the act.’24 The deliberate disregard of objective factors is even more explicitly stated in Buzan &amp; WaeVer’s joint article of the same year.” As a consequence, the phenomenon of threat is reduced to a matter of pure domestic politics.” It seems to me that the security dilemma, as a central notion in security studies, then loses its foundation. Yet I see that Waever himself has no compunction about referring to the security dilemma in a recent article." This discounting of the objective aspect of threats shifts security studies to insignificant concerns. </r><u>What has long made 'threats' and ’threat perceptions’ important phenomena in the study of IR is the implication that <r class="highlighted">urgent action may be required</r>. Urgency, of course, is where Waever first began his argument in favor of an alternative security conception, because a convincing sense of urgency has been the chief culprit behind the abuse of 'security' and the consequent ’politics of panic'</u><r class="font7">, as Waever aptly calls it.” Now, here - in the case of urgency - another baby is thrown out with the Waeverian bathwater. When real situations of urgency arise, those situations are challenges to democracy; they are actually at the core of the problematic arising with the process of making security policy in parliamentary democracy. But in Waever’s world, threats are merely more or less persuasive, and the claim of urgency is just another argument</r><u>. I hold that <r class="highlighted">instead of 'abolishing' threatening phenomena </r>’out there’ by reconceptualizing them, as Waever does, <r class="highlighted">we should</r> continue <r class="highlighted">pay</r>ing <r class="highlighted">attention to them, because situations with </r>a <r class="highlighted">credible </r>claim to <r class="highlighted">urgency will keep coming back </r>and then we need to know more about how they work in the interrelations of groups and states (such as civil wars, for instance), not least to find adequate democratic procedures for dealing with them.</u></p><br> <br> Card Number: 72<br> <br><h4>Our impact is <u>epistemologically sound</u> – it’s based on readings of history and statistically strong modelling – empirics are the best way to make predictions – the alt causes extinction</h4><p>Scott D. <strong>Sagan 95</strong>.

Kenneth Waltz has performed an important service in this regard: his analysis of nuclear proliferation is a valuable corrective against such ethnocentrism and the blind spots it can create among both scholars and government officials. He is absolutely correct, in my view, to criticize a number of proliferation pessimists who argue, in effect, that the United States has been perfect in handling nuclear weapons (but others will not be), that the United States can control these awesome weapons forever (but no one else can), or that the United States has utterly unproblematic civil-military relations (but no one else does). Waltz's analysis should serve as a constant reminder of how dangerous it is in international affairs to assume, to put it crudely, that the United States is smart, but that other nuclear states are or will be stupid. </r><u><r class="highlighted">The second</r> basic error, however, <r class="highlighted">is the opposite: to assume that others are better than we are</r>.

He now appears to accept many of the arguments made by scholars who have studied the operational accidents and near-accidents, conflicts in civil-military relations, and other organizational problems experienced by the United States during the Cold War.
